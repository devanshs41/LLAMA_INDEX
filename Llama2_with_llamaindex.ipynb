Some are \\nwritten for students who may one day continue on in an economics PhD program. These texts develop advanced \\ngeneral equilibrium models and use sophisticated mathematics. However, these texts are also very difficult for the \\naverage, non-PhD-bound student to understand. Other intermediate texts are written for noneconomics majors who \\nmay take only a few economics courses in their program. These texts present descriptive information about the world \\nand only the bare basics about how economic models are used to describe that world. \\nThis text strives to reach a median between these two approaches. First, I believe that students need to learn the \\ntheory and models to understand how economists understand the world. I also think these ideas are accessible to \\nmost students if they are explained thoroughly. This text presents numerous models in some detail, not by employing \\nadvanced mathematics, but rather by walking students through a detailed description of how a model’s assumptions \\ninfluence its conclusions. Second, and perhaps more important, students must learn how the models connect with the \\nreal world. I believe that theory is done primarily to guide policy. We do positive economics to help answer the \\nnormative questions; for example, what should a country do about its trade policy or its exchange rate policy? The \\nresults from models give us insights that help us answer these questions. Thus this text strives to explain why each \\nmodel is interesting by connecting its results to some aspect of a current policy issue. A prime example is found \\nin Chapter 13 \"Fixed versus Floating Exchange Rates\" of this book, which addresses the age-old question of whether \\ncountries use fixed or floating exchange rates. The chapter applies the theories developed throughout the text to assist \\nour understanding of this long-standing debate. \\n  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

An economy is \\nsomething that no one person can observe in its entirety. We are all a part of the economy, we all buy and sell things \\ndaily, but we cannot observe all parts and aspects of an economy at any one time. \\nFor this reason, economists build mathematical models, or theories, meant to describe different aspects of the real \\nworld. For some students, economics seems to be all about these models and theories, these abstract equations and \\ndiagrams. However, in actuality, economics is about the real world, the world we all live in. \\nFor this reason, it is important in any economics course to describe the conditions in the real world before diving into \\nthe theory intended to explain them. In this case, in a textbook about international finance, it is very useful for a \\nstudent to know some of the values of important macroeconomic variables, the trends in these variables over time, \\nand the policy issues and controversies surrounding them. \\nThis first chapter provides an overview of the real world with respect to international finance. It explains not only how \\nthings look now but also where we have been and why things changed along the way. It describes current economic \\nconditions and past trends with respect to the most critical international macroeconomic indicators. In particular, it \\ncompares the most recent worldwide economic recession with past business cycle activity to put our current situation \\ninto perspective. The chapter also discusses important institutions and explains why they have been created. \\nWith this overview about international finance in the real world in mind, a student can better understand why the \\ntheories and models in the later chapters are being developed. This chapter lays the groundwork for everything else \\nthat follows. \\n  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn past trends in international trade and foreign investment. \\n2. Learn the distinction between international trade and international finance. \\nInternational economics is growing in importance as a field of study because of the rapid integration of \\ninternational economic markets. Increasingly, businesses, consumers, and governments realize that their \\nlives are affected not only by what goes on in their own town, state, or country but also by what is \\nhappening around the world. Consumers can walk into their local shops today and buy goods and services \\nfrom all over the world. Local businesses must compete with these foreign products. However, many of \\nthese same businesses also have new opportunities to expand their markets by selling to a multitude of \\nconsumers in other countries. The advance of telecommunications is also rapidly reducing the cost of \\nproviding services internationally, while the Internet will assuredly change the nature of many products \\nand services as it expands markets even further. \\nOne simple way to see the rising importance of international economics is to look at the growth of exports \\nin the world during the past fifty or more years. Figure 1.1 \"World Exports, 1948–2008 (in Billions of U.S. \\nDollars)\" shows the overall annual exports measured in billions of U.S. dollars from 1948 to 2008. \\nFIGURE 1.1 WORLD EXPORTS , 1948–2008 (IN BILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS ) \\n \\nSource: World Trade Organization, International trade and tariff \\ndata,http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/statis_e.htm. \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

A better method is to look at the share of traded goods in relation to the size of the world \\neconomy. Figure 1.2 \"World Exports, 1970–2008 (Percentage of World GDP)\" shows world exports as a \\npercentage of the world gross domestic product (GDP) for the years 1970 to 2008. It shows a steady \\nincrease in trade as a share of the size of the world economy. World exports grew from just over 10 \\npercent of the GDP in 1970 to over 30 percent by 2008. Thus trade is not only rising rapidly in absol ute \\nterms; it is becoming relatively more important too. \\nOne other indicator of world interconnectedness can be seen in changes in the amount of foreign direct \\ninvestment (FDI). FDI is foreign ownership of productive activities and thus is another way in w hich \\nforeign economic influence can affect a country.Figure 1.3 \"World Inward FDI Stocks, 1980–2007 \\n(Percentage of World GDP)\" shows the stock, or the sum total value, of FDI around the world taken as a \\npercentage of the world GDP between 1980 and 2007. It gives an indication of the importance of foreign \\nownership and influence around the world. As can be seen, the share of FDI has grown dramatically from \\naround 5 percent of the world GDP in 1980 to over 25 percent of the GDP just twenty -five years later. \\nFigure 1.2 World Exports, 1970–2008 (Percentage of World GDP) \\n \\nSource: IMF World Economic Outlook Database, \\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/02/weodata/index.aspx. \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In the post–World War II era, \\nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, prompted regular negotiations among a growing \\nbody of members to reciprocally reduce tariffs (import taxes) on imported goods. During each of these \\nregular negotiations (eight of these rounds were completed between 1948 and 1994), countries promised \\nto reduce their tariffs on imports in exchange for concessions— that means tariff reductions— by other \\nGATT members. When the Uruguay Round, the most recently completed round, was finalized in 1994, the \\nmember countries succeeded in extending the agreement to include liberalization promises in a much \\nlarger sphere of influence. Now countries not only would lower tariffs on goods trade but also would begin \\nto liberalize the agriculture and services markets. They would eliminate the many quota systems— like the \\nmultifiber agreement in clothing— that had sprouted up in previous decades. And they would agree to \\nadhere to certain minimum standards to protect intellectual property rights such as patents, trademarks, \\nand copyrights. TheWorld Trade Organization (WTO) was created to manage this system of new \\nagreements, to provide a forum for regular discussion of trade matters, and to implement a well -defined \\nprocess for settling trade disputes that might arise among countries.  \\nFigure 1.3 World Inward FDI Stocks, 1980–2007 (Percentage of World GDP) \\n \\nSource: IMF World Economic Outlook \\nDatabase,http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/02/weodata/index.aspx; \\nUNCTAD, FDI Statistics: Division on Investment and \\nEnterprise,http://www.unctad.org/Templates/Page.asp?intItemID=4979&lang=1 \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

As the club grows to include more members — and if the latest round of trade \\nliberalization talks, called the Doha Round, concludes with an agreement— world markets will become \\nincreasingly open to trade and investment. [1] \\nAnother international push for trade liberalization has come in the form of regional free trade \\nagreements. Over two hundred regional trade agreements around the world have been notified, or \\nannounced, to the WTO. Many countries have negotiated these agreements with neighboring countries or \\nmajor trading partners to promote even faster trade liberalization. In part, these have arisen because of \\nthe slow, plodding pace of liberalization under the GATT/WTO. In part, the regional trade agreements \\nhave occurred because countries have wished to promote interdependence and connectedness with \\nimportant economic or strategic trade partners. In any case, the phenomenon s erves to open international \\nmarkets even further than achieved in the WTO. \\nThese changes in economic patterns and the trend toward ever-increasing openness are an important \\naspect of the more exhaustive phenomenon known as globalization. Globalization more  formally refers to \\nthe economic, social, cultural, or environmental changes that tend to interconnect peoples around the \\nworld. Since the economic aspects of globalization are certainly the most pervasive of these changes, it is \\nincreasingly important to understand the implications of a global marketplace on consumers, businesses, \\nand governments. That is where the study of international economics begins.  \\nWhat Is International Economics? \\nInternational economics is a field of study that assesses the implications of international trade, \\ninternational investment, and international borrowing and lending. There are two broad subfields within \\nthe discipline: international trade and international finance. \\nInternational trade is a field in economics that applies microeconomic models to help understand the \\ninternational economy. Its content includes basic supply-and-demand analysis of international markets; \\nfirm and consumer behavior; perfectly competitive, oligopolistic, and monopolistic market structures; and \\nthe effects of market distortions. The typical course describes economic relationships among consumers, \\nfirms, factory owners, and the government. \\nThe objective of an international trade course is to understand the effects of international trade on \\nindividuals and businesses and the effects of changes in trade policies and other economic conditions.

Its \\nfocus is on the interrelationships among aggregate economic variables such as GDP, unemployment rates, \\ninflation rates, trade balances, exchange rates, interest rates, and so on. This field expands basic \\nmacroeconomics to include international exchanges. Its focus is on the significance of trade imbalances, \\nthe determinants of exchange rates, and the aggregate effects of government monetary and fiscal policies. \\nThe pros and cons of fixed versus floating exchange rate systems are among the important issues \\naddressed. \\nThis international trade textbook begins in this chapter by discussing current and past issues and \\ncontroversies relating to microeconomic trends and policies.

Learn current values for several important macroeconomic indicators from a selected set of \\ncountries, including GDP, GDP per capita, unemployment rates, inflation rates, national budget \\nbalances, and national debts. \\nWhen someone reads the business and economics news it is common to see numerous values and figures \\nused to describe the economic situation somewhere. For example, if you read a story abo ut the Philippines \\nyou might read that the gross domestic product (GDP) is $167 billion or that the GDP per person is \\n$3,500 per person, or that its unemployment rate is 7.1 percent and its inflation rate is now 2.8 percent. \\nYou might read that it has a government budget deficit of 3.7 percent of the GDP and a trade deficit of 5.2 \\npercent of the GDP. But what does this all mean? How is someone supposed to interpret and understand \\nwhether the numbers indicate something good, bad, or neutral about the country ? \\nOne way to make judgments is to compare these numbers with other countries. To this end, the next few \\nsections will present some recent data for a selected set of countries. Although memorizing these numbers \\nis not so important, especially since they will all soon change, it is helpful to have an idea about what the \\nvalues are for a few countries; or if not that, to know the approximate normal average for a particular \\nvariable. Thus it is useful to know that GDP per person ranges from about $500 per year at the low end to \\nabout $50,000 to $75,000 per person at the high end. It is also useful to know that unemployment rates \\nare normally less than 10 percent. So when you read that Zimbabwe recently had unemployment of 75 \\npercent, a reader will know how unusually large that is. Once you also recognize that inflation rates are \\nnormally less than 10 percent, a rate of 10,000 percent will strike you as extraordinary.  \\nThus the values for some of these numbers will be helpful to make comparisons across countries today \\nand to make comparisons over time for a particular country. Therefore, it can be very helpful to know the \\nnumbers for at least a few countries, or what may be deemed a set of reference countries. The countries \\nin Table 1.1 \"GDP and GDP per Capita (PPP in Billions of Dollars), 2009\" were selected to provide a cross \\nsection of countries at different levels of economic development. Thus the United States, the European \\nUnion, and Japan represent the largest economies in the world today.

The most \\nimportant of these, without question, is a country’s gross domestic product (GDP). GDP measures the \\ntotal value of all goods and services produced by a country during a year. As such, it is a measure of the \\nextent of economic activity in a country or the economic size of a country. \\nAnd because the consumption of goods and services is one way to measure an individual’s economic well-\\nbeing, it is easy to calculate the GDP per capita (i.e., per person) to indicate the average well -being of \\nindividuals in a country. \\nDetails about how to measure and interpret GDP follow in subsequent chapters, but before doing so, it \\nmakes some sense to know a little about how economy size and GDP per person vary across countries \\naround the world. Which are the biggest countries, and which are the smallest? Which countries provide \\nmore goods and services, on average, and which produce less? And how wide are the differences between \\ncountries? Table 1.1 \"GDP and GDP per Capita (PPP in Billions of Dollars), 2009\" provides recent \\ninformation for a selected group of countries. Note that reported numbers are based on purchasing power \\nparity (PPP), which is a better way to make cross-country comparisons and is explained later.

Perhaps most distressing is the situation of some \\ncountries like Burundi that has a GDP of only $370 per person. (Other countries in a similar situation \\ninclude Zimbabwe, Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Niger, and Afghanistan.) \\nUnemployment and Inflation around the World \\nTwo other key macroeconomic variables that are used as an indicator of the health of a national economy \\nare the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. The unemployment rate measures the percentage of the \\nworking population in a country who would like to be working but are currently unemployed. The lower \\nthe rate, the healthier the economy and vice versa. The inflation rate measures the annual rate of increase \\nof the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is a ratio that measures how much a set of goods costs this \\nperiod relative to the cost of the same set of goods in some initial year. Thus if the CPI registers 107, it \\nwould cost $107 (euros or whatever is the national currency) to buy the goods today, while it would have \\ncost just $100 to purchase the same goods in the initial period. This represents a 7 percent increase in \\naverage prices over the period, and if that period were a year, it would correspond to the annual inflation \\nrate. In general, a relatively moderate inflation rate (about 0–4 percent) is deemed acceptable; however, if \\ninflation is too high it usually contributes to a less effective functioning of an economy. Also, if inflation is \\nnegative, it is called deflation, and that can also contribute to an economic slowdown. \\nTable 1.2 Unemployment and Inflation Rates \\nCountry/Region Unemployment Rate (%) Inflation Rate (%) \\nEuropean Union 9.8 (Oct. 2009) +0.5 (Nov. 2009) \\nUnited States 10.0 (Nov. 2009) +1.8 (Nov. 2009) \\nChina 9.2 (2008) +0.6 (Nov. 2009) \\nJapan 5.1 (Oct. 2009) −2.5 (Oct. 2009) \\nIndia 9.1 (2008) +11.5 (Oct. 2009) \\nRussia 7.7 (Oct. 2009) +9.1 (Nov. 2009) ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The immediate effect of the crisis was a drop in demand \\nfor many goods and services, a contraction in GDP, and the loss of jobs for workers in many industries. In \\naddition, prices were either stable or fell in many instances.

Governments collect tax revenue from individuals and businesses and use that \\nmoney to finance the purchase of government provided goods and services. Some of the spending is on \\npublic goods such as national defense, health care, and police and fire protection. The g overnment also \\ntransfers money from those better able to pay to others who are disadvantaged, such as welfare recipients \\nor the elderly under social insurance programs. \\nGenerally, if government were to collect more in tax revenue than it spent on programs and transfers, \\nthen it would be running a government budget surplus and there would be little cause for concern. \\nHowever, many governments oftentimes tend to spend and transfer more than they collect in tax revenue. \\nIn this case, they run a government budget deficit that needs to be paid for or financed in some manner. \\nThere are two ways to cover a budget deficit. First, the government can issue Treasury bills and bonds and \\nthus borrow money from the private market; second, the government can sometimes print additional \\nmoney. If borrowing occurs, the funds become unavailable to finance private investment or consumption, \\nand thus the situation represents a substitution of public spending for private spending. Borrowed funds \\nmust also be paid back with accrued interest, which implies that larger future taxes will have to be \\ncollected assuming that budget balance or a surplus is eventually achieved.  \\nWhen governments borrow, they will issue Treasury bonds with varying maturities. Thus some will be \\npaid back in one of two years, but others perhaps not for thirty years. In the meantime, the total \\noutstanding balance of IOUs (i.e., I owe you) that the government must pay back in the future is called \\nthe national debt. This debt is owed to whoever has purchased the Treasury bonds; for many countries, a \\nsubstantial amount is purchased by domestic citizens, meaning that the country borrows from itself and \\nthus must pay back its own citizens in the future. The national debt is often confused with a nation’s \\ninternational indebtedness to the rest of the world, which is known as its international investment \\nposition (defined in the next section). \\nExcessive borrowing by a government can cause economic difficulties. Sometimes private lenders worry \\nthat the government may become insolvent (i.e., unable to repay its debts) in the future. In this case, \\ncreditors may demand a higher interest rate to compensate for the higher perceived risk. To prevent that \\nrisk, governments sometimes revert to the printing of money to reduce borrow ing needs. However, \\nexcessive money expansion is invariably inflationary and can cause long-term damage to the economy.

Thus budget deficits \\nhave ballooned around the world, though to differing degrees.  \\nAs budget deficits rise and as GDP falls due to the recession, national debts as a percent of GDP ar e also \\non the rise in most countries. In the United States, the national debt is still at a modest 37.5 percent, but \\nrecent projections suggest that in a few years it may quickly rise to 60 percent or 70 percent of the GDP. \\nNote also that these figures subtract any debt issued by the government and purchased by another branch \\nof the government. For example, in the United States for the past decade or more, the Social Security \\nsystem has collected more in payroll taxes than it pays out in benefits. The surpl us, known as the Social \\nSecurity “trust fund,” is good because in the next few decades as the baby boom generation retires, the \\nnumbers of Social Security recipients is expected to balloon. But for now the surplus is used to purchase \\ngovernment Treasury bonds. In other words, the Social Security administration lends money to the rest of \\nthe government. Those loans currently sum to about 30 percent of GDP or somewhat over $4 trillion. If \\nwe include these loans as a part of the national debt, the United State s debt is now, according to the online \\nnational debt clock, more than $12 trillion or about 85 percent of GDP. (This is larger than 37.5 + 30 \\npercent because the debt clock is an estimate of more recent figures and reflects the extremely large \\ngovernment budget deficit run in the previous year.) \\nMost other countries’ debts are on a par with that of the U.S. with two notable exceptions. First, China and \\nRussia’s debts are fairly modest at only 15.6 percent and 6.5 percent of GDP, respectively. Second, Japan’s \\nnational debt is an astounding 172 percent of GDP.

Learn current values for several important international macroeconomic indicators from a \\nselected set of countries, including the trade balance, the international investment position, and \\nexchange rate systems. \\nCountries interact with each other in two important ways: trade and investment. Trade encompasses the \\nexport and import of goods and services. Investment involves the borrowing and lending of mo ney and \\nthe foreign ownership of property and stock within a country. The most important international \\nmacroeconomic variables, then, are the trade balance, which measures the difference between the total \\nvalue of exports and the total value of imports, and the exchange rate, which measures the number of \\nunits of one currency that exchanges for one unit of another currency.  \\nExchange Rate Regimes \\nBecause countries use different national currencies, international trade and investment requires an \\nexchange of currency. To buy something in another country, one must first exchange one’s national \\ncurrency for another. Governments must decide not only how to issue its currency but how international \\ntransactions will be conducted. For example, under a traditional gold standard, a country sets a price for \\ngold (say $20 per ounce) and then issues currency such that the amount in circulation is equivalent to the \\nvalue of gold held in reserve. In this way, money is “backed” by gold because individuals are allowed to \\nconvert currency to gold on demand. \\nToday’s currencies are not backed by gold; instead most countries have a central bank that issues an \\namount of currency that will be adequate to maintain a vibrant growing economy with low inflation and \\nlow unemployment. A central bank’s ability to achieve these goals is often limited, especially in turbulent \\neconomic times, and this makes monetary policy contentious in most countries.  \\nOne of the decisions a country must make with respect to its currency is whether to fix its exchange value \\nand try to maintain it for an extended period, or whether to allow its value to float or fluctuate according \\nto market conditions. Throughout history,fixed exchange rates have been the norm, especially because of \\nthe long period that countries maintained a gold standard (with currency fixed to gold) and because of the \\nfixed exchange rate system (called the Bretton Woods system) after World War II.

Because supply and demand for \\ncurrencies fluctuate over time, so do the exchange values, which is why the system is called  floating. \\nNote that India and Indonesia are classified as “managed floating.” This means that the countries’ central \\nbanks will sometimes allow the currency to float freely, but at other times will nudge the exchange rate in \\none direction or another. \\nChina is listed and maintaining a crawling peg, which means that the currency is essentially fixed except \\nthat the Chinese central bank is allowing its currency to appreciate slowly with respect to the U.S. dollar. \\nIn other words, the fixed rate itself is gradually but unpredictably adjusted.  \\nEstonia is listed as having a currency board. This is a method of maintaining a fixed exchange rate by \\nessentially eliminating the central bank in favor of a currency board that is mandated by law to follow \\nprocedures that will automatically keep its currency fixed in value. \\nRussia is listed as fixing to a composite currency. This means that instead of fixing to one other currency, \\nsuch as the U.S. dollar or the euro, Russia fixes to a basket of currencies, also called a composite currency. \\nThe most common currency basket to fix to is the Special Drawing Rights (SDR), a composite currency \\nissued by the IMF used for central bank transactions. \\nFinally, sixteen countries in the European Union are currently members of the euro area. Within this area, \\nthe countries have retired their own national currencies in favor of using a single currency, the euro. \\nWhen all countries circulate the same currency, it is the ultimate in fixity, meaning they have fixed \\nexchange rates among themselves because there is no need to exchange. However, with respect to other \\nexternal currencies, like the U.S. dollar or the Japanese yen, the euro is allowed to float f reely. \\nTrade Balances and International Investment Positions \\nOne of the most widely monitored international statistics is a country’s trade balance.

Of course, if exports equal imports, then \\nthe country has balanced trade. \\nThe terminology is unfortunate because it conveys a negative connotation to trade deficits, a positive \\nconnotation to trade surpluses, and perhaps an ideal connotation to trade balance. Later in the text, we \\nwill explain if or when these connotations are accurate and when they are inaccurate. Suffice it to say, for \\nnow, that sometimes trade deficits can be positive, trade surpluses can be negative, and trade balance \\ncould be immaterial. \\nRegardless, it is popular to decry large deficits as being a sign of danger for an economy, to hail large \\nsurpluses as a sign of strength and dominance, and to long for the fairness and justice that would arise if \\nonly the country could achieve balanced trade. What could be helpful at an early stage, before delving into \\nthe arguments and explanations, is to know how large the countries’ trade deficits and surpluses are. A list \\nof trade balances as a percentage of GDP for a selected set of countries is provided in  Table 1.5 \"Trade \\nBalances and International Investment Positions GDP, 2009\". \\nIt is important to recognize that when a country runs a trade deficit, residents of th e country purchase a \\nlarger amount of foreign products than foreign residents purchase from them. Those extra purchases are \\nfinanced by the sale of domestic assets to foreigners. The asset sales may consist of property or businesses \\n(a.k.a. investment), or it may involve the sale of IOUs (borrowing). In the former case, foreign \\ninvestments entitle foreign owners to a stream of profits in the future. In the latter case, foreign loans \\nentitle foreigners to a future repayment of principal and interest. In this  way, trade and international \\ninvestment are linked. \\nBecause of these future profit takings and loan repayments, we say that a country with a deficit is \\nbecoming a debtor country. On the other hand, anytime a country runs a trade surplus, it is the domesti c \\ncountry that receives future profit and is owed repayments. In this case, we say a country running trade \\nsurpluses is becoming a creditor country. Nonetheless, trade deficits or surpluses only represent the debts \\nor credits extended over a one-year period. If trade deficits continue year after year, then the total external \\ndebt to foreigners continues to grow larger. Likewise, if trade surpluses are run continually, then credits \\nbuild up. However, if a deficit is run one year followed by an equivalent sur plus the second year, rather \\nthan extending new credit to foreigners, the surplus instead will represent a repayment of the previous ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Similarly, if a surplus is followed by an equivalent deficit, rather than incurring debt to \\nforeigners, the deficit instead will represent foreign repayment of the previous year’s credits. \\nAll of this background is necessary to describe a country’s international investment position (IIP), which \\nmeasures the total value of foreign assets held by domestic residents minus the total value of domestic \\nassets held by foreigners. It corresponds roughly to the sum of a country’s trade deficits and surpluses \\nover its entire history. Thus if the value of a country’s trade deficits over time exceeds the value of its trade \\nsurpluses, then its IIP will reflect a larger value of foreign ownership of domestic assets than domestic \\nownership of foreign assets and we would say the country is a net debtor. In contrast, if a country has \\ngreater trade surpluses than deficits over time, it will be a net creditor. \\nNote how this accounting is similar to that for the national debt. A country’s national debt reflects the sum \\nof the nation’s government budget deficits and surpluses over time. If deficits exceed surpluses, as they \\noften do, a country builds up a national debt. Once a debt is present, though, government surpluses act to \\nretire some of that indebtedness. \\nThe key differences between the two are that the national debt is public indebtedness to both domestic \\nand foreign creditors whereas the international debt (i.e., the IIP) is both public and private indebtedness \\nbut only to foreign creditors. Thus repayment of the national debt sometimes represents a transfer \\nbetween domestic citizens and so in the aggregate has no impact on the na tion’s wealth. However, \\nrepayment of international debt always represents a transfer of wealth from domestic to foreign citizens.  \\nTable 1.5 Trade Balances and International Investment Positions GDP, 2009  \\nCountry/Region Trade Balance (%) Debtor (−)/Creditor (+) Position (%) \\nEuro Area −0.9 −17.5 \\nUnited States −3.1 −24.4 \\nChina +6.1 +35.1 \\nJapan +2.7 +50.4 \\nIndia −0.3 −6.8 \\nRussia +2.2 +15.1 ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The United States has also been running a trade deficit \\nfor more than the past thirty years and as a result has amassed a debt to the rest of the world larg er than \\nany other country, totaling about $3.4 trillion or almost 25 percent of U.S. GDP. As such, the U.S. is \\nreferred to as the largest debtor nation in the world. \\nIn stark contrast, during the past twenty-five or more years Japan has been running persistent trade \\nsurpluses. As a result, it has amassed over $2.4 trillion of credits to the rest of the world or just over 50 \\npercent of its GDP. It is by far the largest creditor country in the world. Close behind Japan is China, \\nrunning trade surpluses for more than the past ten years and amassing over $1.5 trillion of credits to other \\ncountries.

One other important creditor country is Russia, with over $25 0 billion in credits \\noutstanding or about 15 percent of its GDP. \\nNote that all three creditor nations are also running trade surpluses, meaning they are expending their \\ncreditor position by becoming even bigger lenders. \\nLike the United States, many other countries have been running persistent deficits over time and have \\namassed large international debts.

International trade fell substantially everywhere in the \\nworld, while investment both domestically and internationally dried up.  \\nThe source of these problems was the bursting of a real estate bubble. Bubbles are fairly common in both \\nreal estate and stock markets. A bubble is described as a steady and persistent increase in prices in a \\nmarket, in this case, in the real estate markets in the United States and abroad. When bubbles are \\ndeveloping, many market observers argue that the prices are reflective of t rue values despite a sharp and \\nunexpected increase. These justifications fool many people into buying the products in the hope that the \\nprices will continue to rise and generate a profit. \\nWhen the bubble bursts, the demand driving the price increases ceases and a large number of participants \\nbegin to sell off their product to realize their profit. When these occur, prices quickly plummet. The \\ndramatic drop in real estate prices in the United States in 2007 and 2008 left many financial institutions \\nnear bankruptcy. These financial market instabilities finally spilled over into the  real sector (i.e., the \\nsector where goods and services are produced), contributing to a world recession. As the current economic \\ncrisis unfolds, there have been many suggestions about similarities between this recession and the Great \\nDepression in the 1930s. Indeed, it is common for people to say that this is the biggest economic \\ndownturn since the Great Depression. But is it? \\nTo understand whether it is or not, it is useful to look at the kind of data used to measure recessions or \\ndepressions and to compare what has happened recently with what happened in the past. First, here are \\nsome definitions. \\nAn economic recession refers to a decline in a country’s measured real gross domestic product (GDP) over \\na period usually coupled with an increasing aggregate unemployment rate.

How much of a decline is necessary before observers will begin to \\ncall it a recession is almost always arguable, although there are a few guidelines one can follow.  \\nIn the United States, it is typical to define a recession as two successive quarters of negative real GDP \\ngrowth. This definition dates to the 1970s and is little more than a rule of thumb, but it is one that has \\nbecome widely applied. A more official way to define a recession is to accept the pronouncements of the \\nNational Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). This group of professional economists looks at more \\nfactors than just GDP growth rates and will also make judgments about when a recession has begun and \\nwhen one has ended. According to the NBER, the current recession began in December 2007 in the \\nUnited States. However, it did not proclaim that until December 2008. Although the U. S. economy \\ncontracted in the fourth quarter of 2007, it grew in the first two quarters of 2008, meaning that it did not \\nfulfill the two successive quarters rule. That wasn’t satisfied until the last two quarters of 2008 both \\nrecorded a GDP contraction. As of January 2010, the U.S. economy continues in a recession according to \\nthe NBER. [1] \\nA very severe recession is referred to as a depression. How severe a recession has to be to be called a \\ndepression is also a matter of judgment. In fact in this regard there are no common rules of thumb or \\nNBER pronouncements. Some recent suggestions in the press are that a depression is when output \\ncontracts by more than 10 percent or the recession lasts for more than two years. Based on the second \\ndefinition and using NBER records dating the length of recessions, the United States experienced \\ndepressions from 1865 to 1867, 1873 to 1879, 1882 to 1885, 1910 to 1912, and 1929 to 1933. Using this \\ndefinition, the current recession could be judged a depression if NBER dates the  end of the contraction to \\na month after December 2009. \\nThe opposite of a recession is an economic expansion or economic boom. Indeed, the NBER measures not \\nonly the contractions but the expansions as well because its primary purpose is to identify the U.S . \\neconomy’s peaks and troughs (i.e., high points and low points). When moving from a peak to a trough the \\neconomy is in a recession, but when moving from a trough to a peak it is in an expansion or boom. The \\nterm used to describe all of these ups and downs over time is the business cycle. \\nThe business cycle has been a feature of economies since economic activity has been measured. The NBER \\nidentifies recessions going back to the 1800s with the earliest listed in 1854. Overall, the NBER has \\nclassified thirty-four recessions since 1854 with an average duration of seventeen months.

Interestingly, since 1982 the United States has experienced three of its longest \\nexpansions segmented only by relatively mild recessions in 1991 and 2001. This had led some observers to \\nproclaim, “The business cycle is dead.” Of course, that was until we headed into the current crisis. (See \\nhere for a complete listing of NBER recessions:http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html.) \\nThe Recession of 2008–2009 \\nNext, let’s take a look at how the GDP growth figures look recently and see how they compare with \\nprevious periods. First, growth rates refer to the percentage change in real GDP, which means that the \\neffects of inflation have been eliminated. The rates are almost always reported in annual terms (meaning \\nthe growth rate over a year) even when the period is defined as one quarter. In the United States and most \\nother countries, GDP growth rates are reported every quarter, and that rate represents how much GDP \\nwould grow during a year if the rate of increase proceeded at the same pace as the growth during that \\nquarter. Alternatively, annual growth rates can be reported as the percentage change in real GDP from the \\nbeginning to the end of the calendar year (January 1 to December 31).  \\nTable 1.6 \"U.S. Real GDP Growth and Unemployment Rate, 2007–2009\" presents the quarterly real GDP \\ngrowth rates from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2009 and the corresponding unemployment rate \\nthat existed during the middle month of each quarter. Note first that in 2007, GDP growth was a \\nrespectable 2 to 3 percent and unemployment was below 5 percent, signs of a healthy economy. However, \\nby the first quarter in 2008, GDP became negative although unemployment remained low. Growth \\nrebounded to positive territory in the second quarter of 2008 while at the same time unemployment \\nbegan to rise rapidly. At this time, there was great confusion about whether the U.S. economy was stalling \\nor whether it was experiencing a temporary slowdown. By late 2008, though, speculation about an \\nimpending recession came to an end. Three successive quarters of signif icant GDP decline occurred \\nbetween the second quarter of 2008 and the end of the first quarter in 2009, while the unemployment \\nrate began to skyrocket. By the middle of 2009, the decline of GDP subsided and reversed to positive \\nterritory by the third quarter. However, the unemployment rate continued to rise, though at a slower pace. \\nWhat happens next is anyone’s guess, but to get a sense of the severity of this recession it is worth ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The ups and downs are analogous \\nto a bicycle smoothly traversing along a smooth road when the rider suddenly hits a l arge obstruction. The \\nobstruction jolts the bike to one side while the rider compensates to pull the bike upright. However, the \\ncompensation is often too much, and the bike swings rapidly to the opposite side. This too inspires an \\nexaggerated response that pushes the bike again too quickly to the original side. In time, the rider regains \\nhis balance and directs the bike along a smooth trajectory.

In late 1980 and early 1981, unemployment didn’t budge despite the rapid revival of \\neconomic growth. In 1983, it took almost a full year of very rapid GDP growth before the unemployment \\nrate began to fall substantially.

The Great Depression was a time that transformed attitudes and \\nopinions around the world and can surely be credited with having established the necessary preconditions \\nfor the Second World War. \\nSo let’s take a look at how bad it really was. Once again, we’ll consider the U.S. experience largely because \\nthe data are more readily available. However, it is worth remembering that al l three of the economic \\ndownturns described here are notable in that they were worldwide in scope.  \\nFirst of all, there is no quarterly data available for the 1930s as quarterly data in the United States first \\nappeared in 1947. Indeed, there was no formal organized collection of data in the 1930s for a variable such \\nas GDP. Thus the numbers presented by the U.S. Bureau of Economic and Analysis (BEA) were \\nconstructed by piecing together available data. \\nA second thing to realize is that annual GDP growth rates tend to have much less variance than quarterly \\ndata. In other words, the highs are not as high and the lows not as low. This is because the annual data are \\naveraging the growth rates over the four quarters. Also, sometimes economic downturns occur at the end \\nof one year and the beginning of the next so that the calendar year growth may still be positive in both \\nyears. For example in 2008, even though GDP growth was negative in three of four quarters, the annual \\nGDP growth that year somehow registered a +0.4 percent. Also in 1980, despite an almost 8 percent GDP \\ndrop in the second quarter, the annual GDP growth that year was −0.3 percent. The same is true for 1982, \\nwhich registered two quarters of negative GDP growth at −6.4 percent and −1.5 percent but still the GDP \\nfell annually at only −1.9 percent. \\nWith this caveat in mind, the U.S. GDP growth rates for the 1930s are astounding. From 1930 to 1933, the \\nUnited States registered annual growth rates of −8.6 percent, −6.5 percent, −13.1 percent, and −1.3 \\npercent. The unemployment rate, which is estimated to have been around 3 percent in the 1920s, rose \\nquickly in 1930 to 8.9 percent and continued to rise rapidly to a height of almost 25 percent in 1933. \\nAlthough growth returned with vigor in 1934 and for another four years, the unemployment rate \\nremained high and only slowly fell to 14.3 percent by 1937. \\nTable 1.8 U.S. Real GDP Growth and Unemployment Rate, 1930–1940 ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In some towns with specialized production \\nin the United Kingdom, unemployment rose as high as 70 percent.  \\nNeedless to say, the Great Depression was indeed “great” in the sense that it was the worst economic \\ndownturn the world experienced in the twentieth century. In comparison, the current recession, which is \\ncoming to be known as the Great Recession, comes nowhere clos e to the severity of the Great \\nDepression…at least for the moment (as of January 2010). A more accurate description of the current \\nrecession is that it is the worst since the 1980s in the United States.

Learn about the origins of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. \\n2. Understand the purpose of the International Monetary Fund both during the fixed exchange rate \\nregime from 1945 to 1973 and after 1973. \\nAfter the Great Depression, one of the things policymakers thought was important was to return the \\ninternational economy to a system of fixed exchange rates. Before the Depression (i.e., in the 1920s and \\nbefore), the world mostly maintained a gold standard. Under such a system, a country establishes two \\nrules: first, it fixes its currency value to a weight of gold; second, it establishes convertibility between the \\ncurrency and gold. This means that any individual holding the national currency is allowed to  cash in the \\ncurrency for its equivalent in gold upon demand. \\nIn essence, the gold standard derives from a system in which gold itself was used as a currency in \\nexchange. Since gold was sufficiently rare and because it was inherently valuable to people, it  was an ideal \\nsubstance to use as a store of value and a medium of exchange (as was silver). However, once trucking \\ngold around became more difficult, it became easier for governments to issue paper currency but to back \\nup that currency with gold on reserve. Thus currency in circulation was just a representation of actual \\ngold in the government’s vault, and if a person ever wished to see that actual gold, he or she could simply \\ndemand conversion. \\nThere is much that can be said about how a gold standard operates, but that discussion is reserved for a \\nlater chapter. For our purposes here, it is sufficient to explain that the gold standard was a system of fixed \\nexchange rates. For example, before the 1930s the United States fixed the dollar at $20.67 per ou nce of \\ngold. During the same period, the United Kingdom fixed its currency at £4.24 per ounce. As a result of the \\ngold-currency convertibility in both countries, this meant the dollar and pound were fixed to each other at \\na rate of $4.875/£. \\nDuring the Depression years, most countries dropped off the gold standard because the loss of confidence \\nthreatened a complete conversion of currency to gold and the depletion of national gold reserves. But, as \\nWorld War II drew to a close, experts were assembled in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in the United \\nStates in 1944 to design a set of institutions that would help establish an effective international monetary ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

One such \\ncatastrophe occurred in Germany in 1922 to 1923 when a floating German currency resulted in one of the \\nworst hyperinflations in modern history. Photos from that period show people with wheelbarrows full of \\nmoney being used to make basic purchases. One way to prevent a reoccurrence was to establish a system \\nof fixed exchange rates. As will be shown later, an important benefit of fixed exchange rates is the \\npotential for such a system to prevent excessive inflation. \\nThe Bretton Woods Conference, more formally called the United Nations Monetary and Financial \\nConference, was held in July 1944. The purpose of the conference was to establish a set of institutions that \\nwould support international trade and investment and prevent some of the monetary instabilities th at had \\nplagued the world after World War I. The conference proposed three institutions, only two of which \\nfinally came into being. \\nThe unsuccessful institution was the International Trade Organization (ITO), which was intended to \\npromote the reduction of tariff barriers and to coordinate domestic policies so as to encourage a freer flow \\nof goods between countries. Although a charter was drawn up for the ITO, the United States refused to \\nsign onto it, fearing that it would subordinate too many of its domestic policies to international scrutiny. A \\nsubagreement of the ITO, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), designed to promote \\nmultilateral tariff reductions, was established independently though.  \\nThe two successfully chartered institutions from the Bretton Woods Conference were \\nthe International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the \\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). \\nThe IBRD is one component of a larger organization called the World Bank. Its purpose was to provide \\nloans to countries to aid their reconstruction after World War II and to promote economic development. \\nMuch of its early efforts focused on reconstruction of the war-torn economies, but by the 1960s, its efforts \\nwere redirected to developing countries. The intent was to  get countries back on their feet, economically \\nspeaking, as quickly as possible. \\nThe second successfully chartered organization was the IMF. Its purpose was to monitor and maintain the \\nstability of the fixed exchange rate system that was established. The system was not the revival of a gold \\nstandard but rather what is known as a gold-exchange standard. Under this system, the U.S. dollar was \\nsingled out as the international reserve currency.

The dollar in turn was fixed to gold at $35 per ounce. The countries \\nalso agreed not to exchange officially held gold deposits for currency as had been the practice under the \\ngold standard. However, countries agreed that officially held gold could be exchanged between central \\nbanks. \\nAnother important requirement designed to facilitate the expansion of international trade was that \\ncountries agreed not to put any restrictions or controls on the exchange of currencies when tha t exchange \\nwas intended for transactions on the current account. In other words, individuals would be free to \\nexchange one currency for another if they wanted to import goods from another country. However, \\ncurrency controls or restrictions were allowed for transactions recorded on the financial accounts. This \\nallowed countries to prevent foreign purchases of businesses and companies or to prevent foreign banks \\nfrom lending or borrowing money. These types of restrictions are commonly known \\nas capital controls (also, currency controls and/or exchange restrictions). These controls were allowed \\nlargely because it was believed they were needed to help maintain the stability of the fixed exchange rate \\nsystem. \\nThe way a fixed exchange system operates in general, and the way the Bretton Woods gold exchange \\nstandard operated in particular, is covered in detail in Chapter 11 \"Fixed Exchange Rates\". For now I will \\nsimply state without explanation that to maintain a credible fixed exchange rate system requires regular \\nintervention in the foreign exchange markets by country central banks. Sometimes to maintain the fixed \\nrate a country might need to sell a substantial amount of U.S. dollars that it is holding on reserve. These \\nreserves are U.S. dollar holdings that had been purchased earlier, but sometimes a country can run what \\nis called a balance of payments deficit— that is, run out of dollar reserves and threaten the stability of the \\nfixed exchange rate system. \\nAt the Bretton Woods Conference, participants anticipated that this scenario would be a common \\noccurrence and decided that a “fund” be established to essentially “bail out” countries that suffered from \\nbalance of payments problems. That fund was the IMF. \\nThe IMF was created to help stabilize exchange rates in the fixed exchange rate system. In particular, \\nmember countries contribute reserves to the IMF, which is then enabled to lend money to countries \\nsuffering balance of payments problems. With these temporary loans, countries can avoid devaluations of \\ntheir currencies or other adjustments that can affect the confidence in the monetary system.

To assure repayment the IMF \\ntypically establishes conditions, known as conditionality, for the recipients of the loans. These conditions \\ngenerally involve changes in monetary and fiscal policies intended to eliminate the original problems with \\nthe balance of payments in the first place. \\nThe role of the IMF has changed more recently though. The fixed exchange rate system, under which the \\nIMF is designed to operate, collapsed in 1973. Since that time, most of the major currencies in the world —\\nincluding the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the Japanese yen, and many others — are floating. When a \\ncurrency is allowed to float, its value is determined by supply and demand in the private market and there \\nis no longer any need for a country’s central bank to intervene. This in turn means that a country can no \\nlonger get into a balance of payments problem since that balance is automatically achieved with the \\nadjustment in the exchange rate value. In essence the raison d’être of the IMF disappeared with the \\ncollapse of the Bretton Woods system. \\nCuriously, the IMF did not fall out of existence. Instead, it reinvented itself as a kind of lender of last \\nresort to national governments. After 1973, the IMF used its “fund” to assist national governments that \\nhad international debt problems. For example, a major debt crisis developed in the early 1980s when \\nnational governments of Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, and eventually many other nations were \\nunable to pay the interest on their external debt, or the money they borrowed from other countries. Many \\nof these loans were either taken by the national governments or were guaranteed by the national \\ngovernments. This crisis, known as the Third World debt crisis, threatened to bring down the \\ninternational financial system as a number of major banks had significant exposure of foreign loans that \\nwere ultimately defaulted on. The IMF stepped in to provide “structural adjustment programs” in this \\ninstance. So the IMF not only loaned money for countries experiencing balanc e of payments crises but \\nalso now provided loans to countries that could not pay back their foreign creditors. And also, because the \\nIMF wanted to get its money back (meaning the money contributed by the member nations), the \\nstructural adjustment loans came with strings attached: IMF conditionality. \\nSince that time, the IMF has lent money to many countries suffering from external debt repayment \\nproblems.

It assisted countries during the Asian currency crisis of 1997 and helped \\nRussia one year later when the Asian contagion swept through. \\nAlthough the IMF has come under much criticism, especially because conditionality is viewed by  some as \\nexcessively onerous, it is worth remembering that the IMF makes loans, not grants. Thus it has the \\nmotivation to demand changes in policies that raise the chances of being repaid. These conditions have \\ngenerally involved things like fiscal and monetary responsibility. That means reducing one’s government \\nbudget deficit and curtailing the growth of the money supply. It also prescribed privatization that involves \\nthe sale or divestiture of state-owned enterprises. The free market orientation of these conditions came to \\nbe known as the Washington Consensus. \\nAlso mitigating the criticisms is the fact that the countries that participate in IMF programs are free to \\naccept the loans, or not. To illustrate the alternative, Malaysia was one country that refu sed to participate \\nin an IMF structural adjustment program during the Asian currency crisis and as a result did not have to \\nsuccumb to any conditions. Thus it is harder to criticize the IMF’s conditions when the countries \\nthemselves have volunteered to participate. In exchange for what were often tens of billions of dollars in \\nloans, these countries were able to maintain their good standing in the international financial community.  \\nAlthough controversial, the IMF has played a significant role in maintaining  the international financial \\nsystem even after the collapse of fixed exchange rates. One last issue worth discussing in this introduction \\nis the issue of moral hazard. In the past thirty years or so, almost every time a country has run into \\ndifficulty repaying its external debt, the IMF has stepped in to assure continued repayment. That behavior \\nsends a signal to international investors that the risk of lending abroad is reduced. After all, if the country \\ngets into trouble the IMF will lend the country money and the foreign creditors will still get their money \\nback. The moral hazard refers to the fact that lending institutions in the developed countries may view the \\nIMF like an insurance policy and thus make much riskier loans than they would have otherwise.  In this \\nway, the IMF could be contributing to the problem of international financial crisis rather than merely \\nbeing the institution that helps clean up the mess. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The World Bank and the IMF were proposed during the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. \\n• The main purpose of the World Bank is to provide loans for postwar reconstruction and \\neconomic development for developing countries.

National product, also called national output, \\nrepresents the market value of all goods and services produced by firms in a country.  \\nBecause of the circular flow of money in exchange for goods and services in an economy, the value of \\naggregate output (the national product) should equal the value of aggregate income (national income). \\nConsider the adjoining circular flow diagram, Figure 2.1 \"A Circular Flow Diagram\", describing a very \\nsimple economy. The economy is composed of two distinct groups: households and firms. Firms produce \\nall the final goods and services in the economy using factor services (labor and capital) supplied by the \\nhouseholds. The households, in turn, purchase the goods and services supplied by the firms. Thus goods \\nand services move between the two groups in the counterclockwise direction. Exchanges are facilitated \\nwith the use of money for payments. \\nThus when firms sell goods and services, \\nthe households give the money to the \\nfirms in exchange. When the households \\nsupply labor and capital to firms, the \\nfirms give money to the households in \\nexchange. Thus money flows between \\nthe two groups in a clockwise direction. \\nNational product measures the \\nmonetary flow along the top part of the \\ndiagram— that is, the monetary value of \\ngoods and services produced by firms in \\nFigure 2.1 A Circular Flow Diagram \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

National income measures the monetary flow along the bottom part of the diagram — that is, \\nthe monetary value of all factor services used in the production process. As long as there are no monetary \\nleakages from the system, national income will equal national product. \\nThe national product is commonly referred to as gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is defined as the \\nvalue of all final goods and services produced within the borders of a country during some period of time, \\nusually a year. A few things are worth emphasizing about this definition.  \\nFirst, GDP is measured in terms of the monetary (or dollar) value at which the items exchange in the \\nmarket. Second, it measures only final goods and services as opposed to intermediate goods. Thus wheat \\nsold by a farmer to a flour mill will not be directly included as part of GDP since the value of the wheat will \\nbe included in the value of the flour that the mill sells to the bakery. The value of the flour will in turn be \\nincluded in the value of the bread sold to the grocery store. Finally, the value of the bread will be included \\nin the price charged by the grocery when the product is finally purchased by the consumer. Only the final \\nbread sale should be included in GDP or else the intermediate values wo uld overstate total production in \\nthe economy. Finally, GDP must be distinguished from another common measure of national output, \\ngross national product (GNP). \\nBriefly, GDP measures all production within the borders of the country regardless of who owns th e factors \\nused in the production process. GNP measures all production achieved by domestic factors of production \\nregardless of where that production takes place. For example, if a U.S. resident owns a factory in Malaysia \\nand earns profits on the operation of that factory, then those profits would be counted as production by a \\nU.S. factory owner and thus would be included in the U.S. GNP. However, since that production took \\nplace beyond U.S. borders, it would not be counted as the U.S. GDP. Alternatively, if  a Dutch resident \\nowns a factory in the United States, then the fraction of that production that accrues to the Dutch owner \\nwould be counted as part of the U.S. GDP since the production took place in the United States. It would \\nnot be counted as part of the U.S. GNP, however, since the production was done by a foreign factor owner.  \\nGDP is probably the most widely reported and closely monitored aggregate statistic. GDP is a measure of \\nthe size of an economy. It tells us the total amount of “stuff” the economy produces. Since most of us, as \\nindividuals, prefer to have more stuff rather than less, it is straightforward to extend this to the national \\neconomy to argue that the higher the GDP, the better off the nation.

Rapid GDP growth is a sign of growing prosperity and economic strength. \\nFalling GDP indicates a recession, and if GDP falls significantly, we call it an economic depression.  \\nFor a variety of reasons, GDP should be used only as a rough indicator of the prosperity or welfare of a \\nnation. Indeed, many people contend that GDP is an inadequate measure of national prosperity. Below is \\na list of some of the reasons why GDP falls short as an indicator of national welfare.  \\n1. GDP only measures the amount of goods and services produced during the year. It does not measure the \\nvalue of goods and services left over from previous years. For example, used cars, two- year-old computers, \\nold furniture, old houses, and so on are all useful and provide welfare to individuals for years after they \\nare produced. Yet the value of these items is only included in GDP in the year in which they are produced. \\nNational wealth, on the other hand, measures the value of all goods, services, and assets available in an \\neconomy at a point in time and is perhaps a better measure of national economic well -being than GDP. \\n2. GDP, by itself, fails to recognize the size of the population that it must support. If we want to use GDP to \\nprovide a rough estimate of the average standard of living among individuals in the economy, then we \\nought to divide GDP by the population to get per capita GDP. This is often the way in which cross -country \\ncomparisons are made. \\n3. GDP gives no account of how the goods and services produced by the economy  are distributed among \\nmembers of the economy. One might prefer a lower GDP with a more equitable distribution to a higher \\nGDP in which a small percentage of the population receives most of the product.  \\n4. Measured GDP growth may overstate the growth of the standard of living since price level increases \\n(inflation) would raise measured GDP. Thus even if the economy produces exactly the same amount of \\ngoods and services as the year before and prices of those goods rise, then GDP will rise as well. For this \\nreason, real GDP is typically used to measure the growth rate of GDP. Real GDP divides nominal (or \\nmeasured) GDP by the price level and is designed to eliminate some of the inflationary effects.  \\n5. Sometimes, economies with high GDPs may also produce a large amou nt of negative production \\nexternalities. Pollution is one such negative externality. Thus one might prefer to have a lower GDP and \\nless pollution than a higher GDP with more pollution. Some groups also argue that rapid GDP growth may \\ninvolve severe depletion of natural resources, which may be unsustainable in the long run.  \\n6. GDP often rises in the aftermath of natural disasters. Shortly after the Kobe earthquake in Japan in the \\n1990s, economists predicted that Japan’s GDP would probably rise more rapidly.

Identify the components of GDP defined in the national income identity. \\n2. Understand why imports are subtracted in the national income identity. \\nThe national income or product identity describes the way in which the gross domestic product (GDP) is \\nmeasured, as the sum of expenditures in various broad spending categories. The identity, show n below, \\nsays that GDP is the sum of personal consumption expenditures ( C), private investment expenditures (I), \\ngovernment consumption expenditures (G), and expenditures on exports (EX) minus expenditures on \\nimports (IM): \\nGDP = C + I + G + EX − IM. \\nPersonal consumption expenditures (C), or “consumption” for short, include goods and services \\npurchased by domestic residents. These are further subdivided into durable goods, commodities that can \\nbe stored and that have an average life of at least three years; nondurable goods, all other commodities \\nthat can be stored; and services, commodities that cannot be stored and are consumed at the place and \\ntime of purchase. Consumption also includes foreign goods and services purchased by domestic \\nhouseholds. \\nPrivate domestic investment (I), or “investment” for short, includes expenditures by businesses on fixed \\ninvestment and any changes in business inventories. Fixed investment, both residential and \\nnonresidential, consists of expenditures on commodities that will be used in a production process for \\nmore than one year. It covers all investment by private businesses and by nonprofit institutions, \\nregardless of whether the investment is owned by domestic residents or not. Nonresidential investment \\nincludes new construction, business purchases of new machinery, equipment, furniture, and vehicles from \\nother domestic firms and from the rest of the world. Residential investment consists of private structures, \\nimprovements to existing units, and mobile homes. Note that this term does not include financial \\ninvestments made by individuals or businesses. For example, one purchase of stock as an “investment” is \\nnot counted here. \\nGovernment expenditures include purchases of goods, services, and structures from domestic firms a nd \\nfrom the rest of the world by federal, state, and local government.

Receipts and \\npayments of factor income and transfer payments to the rest of the world (net) are excluded from net \\nexports. Including these terms changes the trade balance definition and reclassifies national output as \\ngrowth national product (GNP). \\nThe Role of Imports in the National Income Identity \\nIt is important to emphasize why imports are subtracted in the national income identity because it can \\nlead to serious misinterpretations. First, one might infer (incorrectly) from the identity that imports are \\nsubtracted because they represent a cost to the economy. This argument often arises because of the typical \\npolitical emphasis on jobs or employment. Thus higher imports imply that goods that might have been \\nproduced at home are now being produced abroad. This could represent an opportunity cost to the \\neconomy and justify subtracting imports in the identity. However, this argument is wrong.  \\nThe second misinterpretation that sometimes arises is to use the identity to suggest a relationship \\nbetween imports and GDP growth. Thus it is common for economists to report that GDP grew at a slower \\nthan expected rate last quarter because imports rose faster than expected. The identity suggests this \\nrelationship because, obviously, if imports rise, GDP falls. However, this interpretation is also wrong.  \\nThe actual reason why imports are subtracted in the national income identity is because imports appear in \\nthe identity as hidden elements in consumption, investment, government, and exports. Thus imports \\nmust be subtracted to assure that only domestically produced goods are being counted. Consider the \\nfollowing details. \\nWhen consumption expenditures, investment expenditures, government expenditures, and exports are \\nmeasured, they are measured without accounting for where the purchased goods were actually made. \\nThus consumption expenditures (C) measures domestic expenditures on both domestically produced and \\nforeign-produced goods. For example, if a U.S. resident buys a television imported from Korea, that \\npurchase would be included in domestic consumption expenditures. Likewise, if a business purchases a \\nmicroscope made in Germany, that purchase would be included in domestic investment.

Finally, if an intermediate product is imported, used to produce \\nanother good, and then exported, the value of the original imports will be included in the value of \\ndomestic exports. \\nThis suggests that we could rewrite the national income identity in the following way:  \\nGDP = (CD + CF) + (ID + IF) + (GD + GF) + (EXD + EXF) − IM, \\nwhere CD represents consumption expenditures on domestically produced goods,  CFrepresents \\nconsumption expenditures on foreign-produced goods, ID represents investment expenditures on \\ndomestically produced goods, IF represents investment expenditures on foreign-produced \\ngoods, GD represents government expenditures on domestically produced goods,  GF represents \\ngovernment expenditures on foreign-produced goods, EXD represents export expenditures on \\ndomestically produced goods, and EXF represents export expenditures on previously imported \\nintermediate goods. Finally, we note that all imported goods are used in consumption, investment, or \\ngovernment or are ultimately exported, thus \\nIM = CF + IF + GF + EXF. \\nPlugging this expression into the identity above yields \\nGDP = CD + ID + GD + EXD \\nand indicates that GDP does not depend on imports at all. \\nThe reason imports are subtracted in the standard national income identity is because they have already \\nbeen included as part of consumption, investment, government spending, and exports. If imports were \\nnot subtracted, GDP would be overstated. Because of the way the variables are measured, the national \\nincome identity is written such that imports are added and then subtracted again.  \\nThis exercise should also clarify why the previously described misinterpretations were indeed wrong. \\nSince imports do not affect the value of GDP in the first place, they cannot represent an opportunity cost, \\nnor do they directly or necessarily influence the size of GDP growth. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• GDP can be decomposed into consumption expenditures, investment expenditures, government \\nexpenditures, and exports of goods and services minus imports of goods and services. \\n• Investment in GDP identity measures physical investment, not financial investment.

Learn the recent values for U.S. GDP and the relative shares of its major components. \\nTo have a solid understanding of the international economy, it is useful to know the absolute and relative \\nsizes of some key macroeconomic variables like the gross domestic product (GDP). For example, it is \\nworthwhile to know that the U.S. economy is the largest in the world because its annual GDP is about $14 \\ntrillion, not $14 million or $14 billion. It can also be useful to know about how much of an economy’s \\noutput each year is consumed, invested, or purchased by the government. Although knowing that the U.S. \\ngovernment expenditures in 2008 were about $2.9 trillion is not so important, knowing that government \\nexpenditures made up about 20 percent of GDP can be useful to know.  \\nTable 2.2 \"U.S. Gross Domestic Product (in Billions of Dollars)\" contains U.S. statistics for the national \\nincome and product accounts for the years 2007 and 2008. The table provides the numerical breakdown \\nof GDP not only into its broad components (C, I, G, etc.) but also into their major subcategories. For \\nexample, consumption expenditures are broken into three main subcategories: durable goods, nondurable \\ngoods, and services.

The number will also be useful in comparison with U.S. GDP in the future. Thus if in 2020 you \\nread that U.S. GDP is $20 trillion, you’ll be able to recall that back in 2008 it was just $14 trillion. Also, \\nnote that between 2007 and 2008, the United States added over $600 billion to GDP.  \\nThe next thing to note about the numbers is that consumption expenditures are the largest component of \\nU.S. GDP, making up about 70 percent of output in 2008. That percentage is relatively constant over time, \\neven as the economy moves between recessions and boom times (although it is up slightly from 68 \\npercent in 1997). Notice also that services is the largest subcategory in consumption. This category \\nincludes health care, insurance, transportation, entertainment, and so on. \\nGross private domestic investment, “investment” for short, accounted for just 14 percent of GDP in 2008. \\nThis figure is down from almost 17 percent just two years before and is reflective of the slide into  the \\neconomic recession. As GDP began to fall at the end of 2008, prospects for future business opportunities \\nalso turned sour, and so investment spending also fell. As the recession continued into 2009, we can \\nexpect that number to fall even further the next year. \\nThe investment component of GDP is often the target of considerable concern in the United States. \\nInvestment represents how much the country is adding to the capital stock. Since capital is an input into \\nproduction, in general the more capital equipment available, the greater will be the national output. Thus \\ninvestment spending is viewed as an indicator of future GDP growth. Perhaps the higher is investment, \\nthe faster the economy will grow in the future. \\nOne concern about the U.S. investment level is that, as a percentage of GDP, it is lower than in many \\ncountries in Europe, especially in China and other Asian economies. In many European countries, it is \\nabove 20 percent of GDP. The investment figure is closer to 30 percent in Japan and over 35 p ercent in \\nChina. There was a fear among some observers, especially in the 1980s and early 1990s, that lower U.S. \\ninvestment relative to the rest of the world would ultimately lead to slower growth. That this projection \\nhas not been borne out should indicate that higher investment is not sufficient by itself to assure higher \\ngrowth. \\nGovernment expenditures on goods and services in the United States amounted to 20 percent of GDP in \\n2008. Due to the recession and the large government stimulus package in 2009, we can expect this \\nnumber will rise considerably next year.

These are each briefly defined in Table 2.3 \"Balance of Payments Accounts Summary\". \\nTable 2.3 Balance of Payments Accounts Summary \\nCurrent Account \\nRecord of all international transactions for goods and services, income \\npayments and receipts, and unilateral transfers.

For \\nexample, if a U.S. company owns an assembly plant in Costa Rica and brings back to the United States a \\nshare of the profit earned there as a part of its income, then this is classified as an income receipt on the \\ncurrent account of the balance of payments. \\nIt may be helpful to think of income payments and receipts as payments for entrepreneurial services. For \\nexample, a British company running an office building is providing the management services and taking \\nthe risks associated with operating the property. In exchange for these services, the company is entitled to \\na stream of the profit that is earned. Thus income payments are classified as an import, the import of a \\nservice. Similarly, the U.S. company operating the assembly plant in Costa Rica is also providing \\nentrepreneurial services for which it receives income. Since in this case the United States is exporting a \\nservice, income receipts are classified as a U.S. export. \\nUnilateral transfers represent payments that are made or received that do not have an offsetting product \\nflow in the opposite direction. Normally, when a good is exported, for example, the good is exchanged for \\ncurrency such that the value of the good and the value of the currency are equal. Thus there is an outflow \\nand an inflow of equal value. An accountant would record both sides of this transaction, as will be seen in \\nthe next section. However, with a unilateral transfer, money flows out, but nothing comes back in \\nexchange or vice versa. The primary examples of unilateral transfers are remittances and foreign aid. \\nRemittances occur when a person in one country transfers money to a relative in another country and \\nreceives nothing in return. Foreign aid also involves a transfer, expecting nothing in return.  \\nMerchandise Trade Balance \\nThe merchandise trade balance (or goods balance) can be defined as GB = EXG − IMG, where we record \\nonly the export and import of merchandise goods. If GB > 0, the country would have a (merchandise) \\ntrade surplus.

Note that sometimes people \\nwill refer to the difference EXG&S − IMG&S as net exports. Often when this term is used the person is \\nreferencing the goods and services balance. \\nHere it is important to point out that when you hear a reference to a country’s trade balance, it could \\nmean the merchandise trade balance, or it could mean the goods and services balance, or it could even \\nmean the current account balance. \\nOccasionally, one will hear trade deficit figures reported in the U.S. press followed by a comment that the \\ndeficit figures refer to the “broad” measure of trade between countries. In this case, the numbers reported \\nrefer to the current account deficit rather than the merchandise trade deficit. This usage is developing for \\na couple of reasons. First of all, at one time, around thirty years ago or more, there was very little \\ninternational trade in services. At that time, it was common to report the merchandi se trade balance since \\nthat accounted for most of the international trade. In the past decade or so, service trade has been \\ngrowing much more rapidly than goods trade and it is now becoming a significant component of \\ninternational trade. In the United States, service trade exceeds 30 percent of total trade. Thus a more \\ncomplete record of a country’s international trade is found in its current account balance rather than its \\nmerchandise trade account. \\nBut there is a problem with reporting and calling it the current account deficit because most people don’t \\nknow what the current account is. There is a greater chance that people will recognize the trade deficit \\n(although most could probably not define it either) than will recognize the current account deficit. Thus \\nthe alternative of choice among commentators is to call the current account deficit a trade deficit and then \\ndefine it briefly as a “broad” measure of trade. \\nA simple solution would be to call the current account balance the “trade balance” since it is a record of all \\ntrade in goods and services and to call the merchandise trade balance the “merchandise goods balance,” or \\nthe “goods balance” for short.

Both represent \\nthe total value of output in a country during a year, only measured in slightly different ways. It is \\nworthwhile to understand the distinction between the two and what adjustments must be made to \\nmeasure one or the other. \\nConceptually, the gross domestic product (GDP) represents the value of all goods and services produced \\nwithin the borders of the country. The gross national product (GNP) represents the value of all goods and \\nservices produced by domestic factors of production. \\nThus production in the United States by a foreign-owned company is counted as a part of U.S. GDP since \\nthe productive activity took place within the U.S. borders, even though the i ncome earned from that \\nactivity does not go to a U.S. citizen. Similarly, production by a U.S. company abroad will generate income \\nfor U.S. citizens, but that production does not count as a part of GDP since the productive activity \\ngenerating that income occurred abroad. This production will count as a part of GNP though since the \\nincome goes to a U.S. citizen. \\nThe way GDP versus GNP is measured is by including different items in the export and import terms. As \\nnoted above, GDP includes only exports and imports of goods and services, implying also that GDP \\nexcludes income payments and receipts and unilateral transfers. When these latter items are included in \\nthe national income identity and the current account balance is used for  EX − IM, the national income \\nvariable becomes the GNP. Thus the GNP measure includes income payments and receipts and unilateral \\ntransfers.

If KA < 0, then the country has a financial account \\ndeficit. \\nThe financial account records all international trade in assets. Assets represent all forms of ownership \\nclaims in things that have value. They include bonds, Treasury bills, stocks, mutual funds, bank deposits, \\nreal estate, currency, and other types of financial instruments. Perhaps a clearer way to describe exports \\nof assets is to say thatdomestic assets are sold to foreigners, whereas imports of assets mean foreign \\nassets that are purchased by domestic residents. \\nIt is useful to differentiate between two different types of assets. First, some assets represent IOUs (i.e., I \\nowe you). In the case of bonds, savings accounts, Treasury bills, and so on, the purchaser of the asset \\nagrees to give money to the seller of the asset in return for an interest payment plus the return of the \\nprincipal at some time in the future. These asset purchases represent borrowing and lending. When the \\nU.S. government sells a Treasury bill (T-bill), for example, it is borrowing money from the purchaser of \\nthe T-bill and agrees to pay back the principal and interest in the future. The Treasury bill certificate, held \\nby the purchaser of the asset, is an IOU, a promissory note to repay principal plus interest at a \\npredetermined time in the future. \\nThe second type of asset represents ownership shares in a business or property, which is held in the \\nexpectation that it will realize a positive rate of return in the future. Assets, such as common stock, give \\nthe purchaser an ownership share in a corporation and entitle the owner to a stream of dividend \\npayments in the future if the company is profitable. The future sale of the stock may also generate a \\ncapital gain if the future sales price is higher than the purchase price. Similarly, real estate purchases —\\nsay, of an office building— entitle the owner to the future stream of rental payments by the tenants in the \\nbuilding. Owner-occupied real estate, although it does not generate a stream of rental payments, does \\ngenerate a stream of housing services for the occupant-owners. In either case, if real estate is sold later at \\na higher price, a capital gain on the investment will accrue. \\nAn important distinction exists between assets classified as IOUs and assets consisting of ownership \\nshares in a business or property. First of all, IOUs involve a contractual obligation to repay principal plus \\ninterest according to the terms of the contract or agreement. Failure to do so i s referred to as a default on \\nthe part of the borrower and is likely to result in legal action to force repayment. Thus international asset \\npurchases categorized as IOUs represent international borrowing and lending.

It is measured by using the goods and services balance for exports and imports. \\n• GNP is a measure of national income that includes all production by U.S. citizens that occurs \\nanywhere in the world. It is measured by using the current account balance for exports and \\nimports. \\n• The financial account balance measures all exports and imports of assets, which means foreign \\npurchases of domestic assets and domestic purchases of foreign assets. \\nEXERCISE  \\n1.

Learn how individual transactions between a foreign and domestic resident are recorded on the \\nbalance of payments accounts. \\n2. Learn the interrelationship between a country’s current account balance and its financial \\naccount balance and how to interpret current account deficits and surpluses in terms of the \\nassociated financial flows. \\nIn this section, we demonstrate how international transactions are recorded on the balance of payment \\naccounts. The balance of payments accounts can be presented in ledger form with two columns. One \\ncolumn is used to record credit entries. The second column is used to record debit entries.  \\nAlmost every transaction involves an exchange between two individuals of two items believed to be of \\nequal value. [1] Thus if one person exchanges $20 for a baseball bat with another person, then the two \\nitems of equal value are the $20 of currency and the baseball bat. The debit and credit columns in the \\nledger are used to record each side of every transaction. This means that every transaction must result in a \\ncredit and debit entry of equal value. \\nBy convention, every credit entry has a “+” placed before it, while every debit entry has a “−” placed before \\nit. The plus on the credit side generally means that money is being received in exchange for that item, \\nwhile the minus on the debit side indicates a monetary payment for that item. This interpretation in the \\nbalance of payments accounts can be misleading, however, since in many international transactions, as \\nwhen currencies are exchanged, money is involved on both sides of the transaction. There are two simple \\nrules of thumb to help classify entries on the balance of payments:  \\n1. Any time an item (good, service, or asset) is exported from a country, the value of that item is recorded as \\na credit entry on the balance of payments. \\n2. Any time an item is imported into a country, the value of that item is recorded as a debit entry on the \\nbalance of payments. \\nIn the following examples, we will consider entries on the U.S. balance of p ayments accounts. Since it is a \\nU.S. account, the values of all entries are denominated in U.S. dollars. Note that each transaction between \\na U.S. resident and a foreign resident would result in an entry on both the domestic and the foreign \\nbalance of payments accounts, but we will look at only one country’s accounts.

Any time an item in a transaction is a good or a \\nservice, the value of that item will be recorded in the current account. Any time an item in a transaction is \\nan asset, the value of that item will be recorded in the financial account.  \\nNote that in June 1999, what was previously called the “capital account” was renamed the “financial \\naccount” in the U.S. balance of payments. A capital account stills exists but now includes only exchanges \\nin nonproduced, nonfinancial assets. This category is very small, including such items as debt forgiveness \\nand transfers by migrants. However, for some time, it will be common for individuals to use the term \\n“capital account” to refer to the present “financial account.” So be warned. \\nA Simple Exchange Story \\nConsider two individuals, one a resident of the United States, the other a resident of Japan. We will follow \\nthem through a series of hypothetical transactions and look at how each of these transactions would be \\nrecorded on the balance of payments. The exercise will provide insight into the relationship between the \\ncurrent account and the financial account and give us a mechanism for interpreting trade deficits and \\nsurpluses. \\nStep 1: We begin by assuming that each individual wishes to purchase something in the other country. \\nThe U.S. resident wants to buy something in Japan and thus needs Japanese currency (yen) to make the \\npurchase. The Japanese resident wants to buy something in the United States and thus needs U.S. \\ncurrency (dollars) to make the purchase. Therefore, the first step in the story must involve an exchange of \\ncurrencies. \\nSo let’s suppose the U.S. resident exchanges $1,000 for ¥112,000 on the foreign exchange market at a spot \\nexchange rate of 112 ¥/$. The transaction can be recorded by noting the following:  \\n1. The transaction involves an exchange of currency for currency. Since currency is an asset, both sides of \\nthe transaction are recorded on the financial account. \\n2. The currency exported is $1,000 in U.S. currency. Hence, we have made a credit entry in the financial \\naccount in the table below. What matters is not whether the item leaves the country, but that the \\nownership changes from a U.S. resident to a foreign resident. \\n3. The currency imported into the country is the ¥112,000. We record this as a debit entry on the financial \\naccount and value it at the current exchange value, which is $1,000 as noted in the table.

This is recorded as a cred it \\nentry on the financial account and labeled “¥ currency” in the table below. The item being imported into \\nthe United States is a camera.

When a country has a current account surplus, it must have a financial account deficit of \\nequal value. And when a country has balanced trade (a balanced current account), then it must have \\nbalance on its financial account. \\nIt is worth emphasizing that this relationship is not an economic theory. An economic theory could be \\nright or it could be wrong. This relationship is an accounting identity. (That’s why an identity symbol \\nrather than an equal sign is typically used in the formula above.) An accounting identity is true by \\ndefinition. \\nOf course, the identity is valid only if we use the true (or actual) current account and financial account \\nbalances. What countries report as their trade statistics are only themeasured values for these trade \\nbalances, not necessarily the true values. \\nStatisticians and accountants attempt to measure international transactions as accurately as possible. \\nTheir objective is to record the true values or to measure trade and financial flows as accurately as \\npossible. However, a quick look at any country’s balance of payments statistics reveals that the balance on \\nthe current account plus the balance on the financial account rarely, if ever, sums to zero. The reason is \\nnot that the identity is wrong but rather that not all the international transactions on the balance of \\npayments are accounted for properly. Measurement errors are common.  \\nThese errors are reported in a line in the balance of payments labeled “statistical discrepancy.” The \\nstatistical discrepancy represents the amount that must be added or subtracted to force the measured \\ncurrent account balance and the measured financial account balance to zero. In other words, in terms of \\nthe measured balances on the balance of payments accounts, the following relationship will hold:  \\ncurrent account balance + financial account balance + statistical discrepancy = 0. \\nThe second lesson from this example is that imbalances (deficits and surpluses) on the balance of \\npayments accounts arise as a result of a series of mutually voluntary transactions in which equally valued \\nitems are traded for each other. This is an important point because it is often incorrectly interpreted that a \\ntrade deficit implies that unfair trade is taking place. After all, the logic goes, when imports exceed \\nexports, foreigners are not buying as many of our goods as we are buying of theirs. That’s unequal \\nexchange and that’s unfair.

The logic of the argument focuses exclusively on \\ntrade in goods and services but ignores trade in assets. Thus it istrue that when imports of goods exceed \\nexports, we are buying more foreign goods and services than foreigners are buying of ours. However, at \\nthe same time, a current account deficit implies a financial account surplus. A financial account surplus, \\nin turn, means that foreigners are buying more of our assets than we are buying of theirs. Thus when there \\nis unequal exchange on the trade account, there must be equally opposite unequal exchange on the \\nfinancial account. In the aggregate, imbalances on a current account, a trade account, or a financial \\naccount do not represent unequal exchanges between countries. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Every transaction between a domestic and foreign resident can be recorded as a debit and credit \\nentry of equal value on the balance of payments accounts. \\n• All components of transactions that involve assets, including currency flows, are recorded on the \\nfinancial account; all other items are recorded on the current account. \\n• All trade deficits on a country’s current account implies an equally sized financial account surplus, \\nwhile all trade surpluses implies an equally sized financial account deficit. \\n• In the aggregate, imbalances on a current account, a trade account, or a financial account do not \\nrepresent unequal exchanges, or inequities, between countries. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Learn the interrelationship between a country’s government budget balance (deficit) and its \\ncurrent account balance (deficit). \\n2. Interpret the interrelationships of trade balances and budget balances in terms of the sources \\nand uses of funds in the financial system. \\nOne of the important relationships among aggregate economic variables is the so-called twin-\\ndeficit identity, a term in reference to a country’s government budget deficit and a simultaneous current \\naccount deficit. The name for this identity became commonplace during the 1980s and 1990s because at \\nthat time the United States experienced deficits in both of these accounts. Now, as we will see later, the \\nidentity will be a misnomer in many circumstances since there is no reason that “twin” deficits need to \\nalways appear together on these two national accounts. In fact, some countries will, at times, experience a \\ndeficit on one account and a surplus on the other. Also, at times, a country will experience a surplus on \\nboth accounts. \\nThus a better title to this section would be “The Relationship between a Country’s Government Budget \\nDeficit and Its Current Account Deficit.” However, since 2004, the United States finds itself back in the \\ntwin-deficit scenario, and since “twin-deficit identity” rolls off the tongue much more easily, we will stick \\nto this title. \\nTo understand this identity it will be helpful to take a much more careful look at the national income \\nidentity. This time I will build up the identity in a stepwise fashion using a circular flow diagram to better \\nvisualize the flows of money within an economy. A circular flow diagram is typically one of the first \\nprinciples shown to students in an introductory macroeconomics class. Its purpose is to show the flow of \\nmoney between the major players (or agents) within an economy. Circular flow  diagrams can be either \\nsimple or complex depending on how many agents one introduces into the system and how finely one \\nwishes to break down the monetary flows. \\nCircular Flow: Version 1 \\nThe simplest version of a circular flow diagram considers an economy consisting of two agents: \\nhouseholds and firms.

Some of the revenue earned by firms is not actually given out to workers in \\nthe form of wages. Instead some money is “retained” in the form of profit and excess earnings. These \\nretained earnings are generally used to purchase investment goods to help an industry replace worn -out \\ncapital equipment and to add new capital. Much of these retained earnings may be used directly to \\npurchase new capital equipment, although some of it will be saved by depositing it in a financial \\ninstitution. For simplicity we will imagine that all such business saving flows through the financial system, \\nhence the SB arrow. In addition, households generally hold back some of their income from spending and \\ndeposit it into pension plans, savings accounts, and so on. Thus we include the arrow from households. \\nThe easiest way to think of the diagram is to imagine that financial institutions take deposits from firms \\nand households and then lend out the money to finance investment spending,  I. With some exceptions, \\nthis is the way it will often work. One notable exception is that some of the money lent by banks is often \\nused to finance consumption rather than investment. This occurs whenever households finance \\nconsumption spending using a credit card. However, we can avoid this compl ication by defining SHH as \\nbeing “net” savings, where the net means “after subtracting household borrowing.” With this definition in \\nmind, it should be clear that SHH can be negative— that is, its flow reversed— if household borrowing \\nexceeds household saving. \\nWe can now identify several important relationships. The first one relates to an important decision made \\nby households. They choose how much of their disposable income should be spent on consumption and \\nhow much should be saved. You may recall from previous courses that the fraction of income spent on \\nconsumption goods (from an extra dollar of income) is called the  marginal propensity to consume, while \\nthe fraction of income saved is called the marginal propensity to save.  \\nA second relationship is shown on the left side of the Firms box. This indicates that GNP is equal to the \\nsum of C and I. This version of the national income identity would only be valid if there were no \\ngovernment sector and no trade with the rest of the world. \\nA third important relationship is shown by noting the flow of money in and out of the financial sector. \\nThere we see two arrows flowing in (i.e., SHH and SB) and one flow outward (i.e., I).

A more common \\nsimplification of this relationship is shown by noting the following:  \\nSP = SHH + SB, \\nwhere SP is called private saving. Thus private saving equals the sum of household saving and business \\nsaving. This will simplify the above identity to \\nSP = I, \\nor simply, private saving equals investment.

The government is shown both \\nto take money out of the circular flow and to \\ninject money back in. Money is withdrawn first \\nin the form of taxes (T). In the adjoining \\ndiagram, taxes are represented as a flow of \\nmoney directly from firms, as if it is \\nentirely a tax on income. This is a \\nsimplification since in reality taxes are \\ncollected in many forms from many \\ndifferent agents. For example, \\ngovernments collect profit taxes from firms \\nand financial institutions, sales and property taxes from households, and tariffs on traded goods (not \\nincluded yet). All of these taxes are assumed to be lumped together in the  T flow and withdrawn directly \\nfrom national income. \\nTax revenues (TR) can be spent in two separate ways. The TR flow represents transfer payments injected \\ninto the household income stream. Transfer payments include social security paid to retired workers, \\nMedicaid and welfare payments, unemployment, and so on. These are government expenditures that do \\nnot exchange for a particular good or service. The second type of expenditure is  G.

It includes defense spending, \\neducation, police and fire protection, and so on. \\nThe final monetary flow, shown flowing out of the government, is labeled  SG and refers to government \\nsaving. It should be obvious that the money collected by government in the form of taxes need not always \\nequal government expenditures. In the event that tax revenues exceed expenditures, the government \\nwould have extra money left over. We imagine that this money would be saved in the financial sector since \\nit is always better to collect interest when possible. Hence we draw the flow of excess funds, government \\nsaving (SG), flowing from government into the financial sector. \\nWe can now represent the flow of funds in and out of the government sector with the following identity:  \\nSG = T − TR − G. \\nWhen T exceeds the sum of TR and G, the government has extra saving that flows into the financial sector. \\nThese funds would then be available to lend out and finance additional investment.  \\nOf course, what is more typical of many governments is for the sum of  TR and G to exceed tax revenue, T. \\nIn this case, the flow of government saving (SG) would be negative and would be represented in the \\ndiagram as a flow in the opposite direction. In this case, the government would be borrowing money from \\nthe financial sector to finance its excess expenditures. We would also say that the government is running a \\nbudget deficit. \\nIn short, negative government saving, that is, SG < 0, implies a government budget deficit, which the \\ngovernment finances by borrowing from the financial sector. \\nOtherwise, positive government saving, that is, SG > 0, implies a government budget surplus, which \\nresults either in additions to saving or a repayment of previous debt. \\nNext, in this version of the circular flow, we can represent the national income identity as the flow of \\nmoney into firms. In this case, GNP equals the sum of C, I, and G. This version would only be Accurate \\nwhen there is no trade with the rest of the world. \\nLastly, with government included, we must rewrite the relationship representing the flows in and out of \\nthe financial sector.

The rest of the world \\n(RoW) is shown at the very bottom of the \\nadjoining diagram, below the dotted line, which \\nrepresents the border. Trade with the RoW \\nconsists first of exports of goods, services, \\nincome and transfers, and expenditures on \\nexports (EX), represented by a flow into firms \\nsince money is being used by foreigners to \\npurchase the exported products. Second, \\nimports of goods, services, income and transfers, \\nand imports (IM) are subtracted from firms, \\nresulting in an arrow from firms to the RoW. \\nThis adjustment accounts for the fact that measured expenditures made by households, the government, \\nand firms in a open economy will consist of purchases of both domestic and imported goods. Thus \\nthe C, I, and G flows will include their purchases of imports, and these should not be included as part of \\nGNP. In essence, the money used to buy imported products is redirected to the foreign firms, hence we \\nhave the outflow of money. (For a more complete explanation see Chapter 2 \"National Income and the \\nBalance of Payments Accounts\", Section 2.1 \"National Income and Product Accounts\".) \\nThis completes the national income identity with all major sectors included and now becomes  \\nGNP = C + I + G + EX − IM, \\nwhich is represented by the flow of money into (and away from) firms on the left side of the diagram. \\nHowever, as noted elsewhere, EX − IM, the balance on the current account, need not be equal to zero. \\nIf EX − IM > 0, then the country would have a current account (CA) surplus, whereas if  EX − IM < 0 the \\ncountry would have a CA deficit. \\nFigure 2.5 The Circular Flow Adding the RoW \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In this case, more money flows out to purchase imports than flows back in to \\npurchase exports. Essentially, there is a loss of money to the RoW despite some exceptions; however, this \\nmoney does not remain outside the country. Instead, it is brought right back in and deposited into \\nfinancial institutions (shown as the SF flow on the diagram). In other words, it is saved. This saving \\nrepresents the country’s financial account surplus, which is equal and opposite to the CA deficit \\n(see Chapter 2 \"National Income and the Balance of Payments Accounts\",Section 2.5 \"Recording \\nTransactions on the Balance of Payments\" for a more complete explanation). \\nThe key point is that foreign saving offsets the CA deficit. This can be represented by the relationship \\nshowing the inflows and outflows from the RoW, namely, \\nSF = IM − EX. \\nThis says that foreign saving equals the CA deficit. From the perspective of the foreigners, we would refer \\nto SF as money saved or lent to the domestic country. From the perspective of the domestic \\ncountry, SF would be considered money borrowed from the RoW. \\nClearly, since a country may run a surplus on trade (i.e., EX − IM > 0), SF could also be negative. In this \\ncase, the RoW would either be dissaving, meaning it is withdrawing previously accumulated saving from \\nthe domestic country, or the RoW would be borrowing money from the domestic country. This would \\noccur if a domestic bank makes a loan to someone abroad. Alternatively, from the perspective of the \\ndomestic country, we can say it is lending money to the RoW when SF < 0. \\nFinally, the Twin-Deficit Identity \\nThe twin-deficit identity is derived by accounting for the monetary flows in and out of the financial sector \\nin version four of the circular flow. This results in the following identity:  \\nSHH + SB + SG + SF = I. \\nThis says that the sum of household saving, business saving, government saving, and foreign saving must \\nequal private investment spending. An equivalent version can be written by recalling that household plus \\nbusiness saving equals private saving to get \\nSP + SG + SF = I. \\nThe identity is best interpreted by noting that there are four key sources for funds in the financial sector \\nthat are not part of the consumption stream.

Also, the sum of all funds not used for \\nconsumption must be equal to the amount spent on investment goods.  \\nIt is important to note that this relationship is an accounting identity. This means that the relationship \\nmust be true as long as all variables are measured properly. This is notan economic theory, which is a \\nproposition that may or may not be true. In practice, this identity rarely adds up, however, because the \\nvariables are not typically measured accurately. \\nTo turn this identity into the “twin-deficit” identity, we must merely take note of several previous \\ndefinitions. Recall that \\nSG = T − TR − G,SF = IM − EX, \\nand \\nSP = SHH + SB. \\nPlugging these into identity 1 above yields \\nSP + T − TR − G + IM − EX = I. \\nReorder these to get the following twin-deficit identity: \\n(SP − I) + (IM − EX) = (G + TR − T). \\nThis is a popular way of writing the twin-deficit identity since it explicitly indicates two deficits. If the \\nsecond expression (IM − EX) > 0, then the country has a current account deficit (i.e., a trade deficit). If \\nthe right-hand-side expression (G + TR − T) > 0, then the country has a government budget deficit. The \\nexpression in total, then, demonstrates that these two deficits are related to each other according to this \\naccounting identity. Indeed, the difference between the government budget deficit and the trade deficit \\nmust equal the difference between private saving and investment as shown here: \\n(SP − I) = (G + TR − T) − (IM − EX). \\nThe Twin-Deficit Relationship in the United States and China \\nPerhaps the best way to get a feel for the twin-deficit relationship in a country is to look at the \\nnumbers.

This demonstrates that twin “deficits” do not always arise despite the \\nlabel used to describe the identity. During the budget surplus years the government was able to retire \\nsome of its outstanding debt, but the country also ran CA deficits implying, essentially, borrowings from \\nforeigners. As in 2007, these years also describe periods in which foreign borrowings are used to maintain \\na higher investment level than can be sustained with the lower national savings rate.  \\nIn contrast, consider the twin-deficit numbers calculated in the same way for China during t he same \\nperiod. The differences with the U.S. numbers are striking. The two things that stand out immediately are \\nthe significantly higher values for private saving and investment. Instead of numbers in the midteens in \\nthe United States, China’s percentages are in the midforties to low fifties. Again, the savings terms are \\ncalculated as residuals, so there may be some error there, but nonetheless it is clear that China both saves \\nand invests about three times more than the United States as a percentage of G DP. Because it invests so \\nmuch more, the implication from the national income identity is that China consumes much less than the \\nUnited States as a percentage. Indeed, China’s consumption figures (not shown) are usually less than 50 \\npercent of GDP. \\nIndeed, this is why China and many other Asian economies are described as high -saving and low-\\nconsuming countries. The United States in comparison is described as a high -consumption country and \\nlow-saving country. \\nThe negative number on China’s CA deficit in all the years means that China has run a trade surplus. A \\nsurplus means it is lending money abroad and forgoing consumption, by another 11 percent in 2007. (This \\nwill be explained in more detail in Chapter 3 \"The Whole Truth about Trade Imbalances\".) Also, the \\nnegative number for China’s budget balance means that it was running a government budget surplus in \\n2007. So in 2007, China had twin surpluses— a much rarer occurrence— rather than twin deficits. In \\nprevious years China didn’t have twin anything: running trade surpluses that were increasing through the \\npast decade, and government budget deficits. \\nIt is worth reflecting briefly on the large investment and trade surpluses in China in comparison with the \\nUnited States. The U.S. per capita GDP is about $47,000. Comprising that per person production is about \\n15 percent that goes into investment.

Learn how to define and interpret a country’s international investment position. \\n2. Understand how the international investment position is updated from year to year. \\nA country’s international investment position (IIP) is like a balance sheet in that it shows the total \\nholdings of foreign assets by domestic residents and the total holdings of domestic assets by foreign \\nresidents at a point in time. In the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) financial statistics, these are \\nlisted as domestic assets (foreign assets held by domestic residents) and domestic liabilities (domestic \\nassets owned by foreign residents). The financial account balance, whose counterpart is the current \\naccount balance, is more like an income statement that shows the changes in asset holdings during the \\npast year. In other words, the financial account balance consists of flow variables since it records changes \\nin the country’s asset holdings during the year, while the international asset position of a country consists \\nof stock variables since it records the total value of assets at a point in time.  \\nA country’s net international asset position may be in surplus, deficit, or balance. If in surplus, then the \\nvalue of foreign assets (debt and equity) held by domestic residents exceeds the value of domestic assets \\nheld by foreigners. Alternatively, we could say that domestic assets exceed domestic liabilities. This \\ncountry would then be referred to as acreditor country. If the reverse is true, so that domestic liabilities to \\nforeigners exceed domestic assets, then the country would be called a  debtor country. \\nAsset holdings may consist of either debt obligations or equity claims. Debt consists of IOUs (i.e., I owe \\nyou) in which two parties sign a contract agreeing to an initial transfer of money from the lender to the \\nborrower followed by a repayment according to an agreed schedule. The debt contract establishes an \\nobligation for the borrower to repay principal and interest in the future. Equity claims represent \\nownership shares in potentially productive assets. Equity holdings do not establish obligations between \\nparties, at least not in the form of guaranteed repayments. Once ownership in an asset is transferred from \\nseller to buyer, all advantages and disadvantages of the asset are transferred as well.  \\nDebt and equity obligations always pose several risks. The first risk with debt obligations is the risk of \\npossible default (either total or partial). To the lender, default risk means that the IOU will not be repaid \\nat all, that it will be repaid only in part, or that it is repaid over a much longer period of time than \\noriginally contracted. The risk of default to the borrower is that future borrowing will likely become ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The advantage of default to the borrower, of course, is that not all the borrowed money is \\nrepaid. The second risk posed by debt is that the real value of the repayments may be different than \\nexpected. This can arise because of unexpected inflation or unexpected currency changes. Consider \\ninflation first. If inflation is higher than expected, then the real value of debt repayment (if the nominal \\ninterest rate is fixed) will be lower than originally expected. This will be an advantage to the borrow er, \\nwho repays less in real terms, and a disadvantage to the lender, who receives less in real terms. If inflation \\nturns out to be less than expected, then the advantages are reversed. Next, consider currency fluctuations. \\nSuppose a domestic resident, who receives income in the domestic currency, borrows foreign currency in \\nthe international market. If the domestic currency depreciates, then the value of the repayments in \\ndomestic currency terms will rise even though the foreign currency repayment value rem ains the same. \\nThus currency depreciations can be harmful to borrowers of foreign currency. A similar problem can arise \\nfor a lender. Suppose a domestic resident purchases foreign currency and then lends it to a foreign \\nresident (note that this is the equivalent of saving money abroad). If the domestic currency appreciates, \\nthen foreign savings, once cashed in, will purchase fewer domestic goods and the lender will lose.  \\nThe risk of equity purchases arises whenever the asset’s rate of return is less than expected. This can \\nhappen for a number of different reasons. First, if the equity purchases are direct investment in a \\nbusiness, then the return on that investment will depend on how well the business performs. If the market \\nis vibrant and management is good, then the investment will be profitable. Otherwise, the rate of return \\non the investment could be negative. All the risk, however, is borne by the investor. The same holds true \\nfor stock purchases. Returns on stocks may be positive or negative, but it is the purchaser who bears full \\nresponsibility for the return on the investment. Equity purchases can suffer from exchange rate risk as \\nwell. When foreign equities are purchased, their rate of return in terms of domestic currency will depend \\non the currency value. If the foreign currency in which assets are denominated falls substantially in value, \\nthen the value of those assets falls along with it. \\nThe U.S. International Investment Position \\nThe United States is the largest debtor nation in the world.

(Refer to cell I22 in \\nspreadsheet.) Excluding financial derivatives that refer to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, the \\nUnited States was in debt in the amount −$3.628 trillion (cell I24). \\nNote that this valuation is the U.S. “net” investment position, meaning that it is the difference between the \\nsum total value of foreign assets owned by U.S. residents (U.S. assets abroad) minus U.S. assets owned by \\nforeigners (foreign-owned assets in the United States). The first of these, U.S. as sets abroad, represents \\nour purchases of foreign equities and money we have lent to foreigners. The total value stood at $19.888 \\ntrillion in 2008 using market value methods (cell I26). The second, foreign -owned assets in the United \\nStates, represents foreign purchases of U.S. equities and money foreigners have lent to us or, equivalently, \\nthat we have borrowed. The total in 2008 stood at $23.357 trillion (cell I50).  \\nThe size of the U.S. debt position causes worry for some. Thirty years ago the United States  had a sizable \\ncreditor position. However, as a result of trade deficits run throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the United \\nStates quickly turned from a net creditor to a net debtor. The changeover occurred in 1989. In the early \\n1990s, the size of this debt position was not too large compared to the size of the economy; however, by \\nthe late 1990s and early 2000s, the debt ballooned. In 2008, the U.S. debt position stood at 24.6 percent \\nof GDP, which interestingly is down slightly from 24.9 percent of GDP in 2002 despite annual current \\naccount deficits since then. The reason for these changes is changes in the valuations of assets, as reflected \\nin stock market prices, real estate price changes, and changes in the exchange rate.  \\nNotice in the 2008 BEA IIP spreadsheet that the investment position is derived from the 2007 position in \\nthe following way. First, the current account deficit caused an addition to U.S. external debt of $505 \\nbillion (cell D22). Changes in asset prices both here and abroad further increased U.S. external debt by \\n$720 billion (cell E22). This could be because either real estate prices abroad fell by more than in the \\nUnited States or security prices abroad fell by more than in the United States. Next, there was another \\nincrease of $583 billion in external U.S. debt because of changes in exchange rates. In this case, an \\nappreciation of the U.S. dollar increased the values of foreign-held U.S. assets and reduced the value of \\nU.S.-held foreign assets. Finally, U.S. external debt decreased by $479 billion due to other factors that \\ndon’t neatly fit into the first two categories. (See footnote 2 in the BEA IIP spreadsheet.) \\nFor several reasons, the debt is not a cause for great worry, although it is growing quickly.

In Argentina and Brazil, \\ninternational debt positions exceeded 60 percent of their GDPs. For some less -developed countries, \\ninternational debt at times has exceeded 100 percent of their annual GDP.  \\nA second important point is that much of our international obligations are denominated in our own home \\ncurrency. This means that when international debts (principal + interest) are paid to foreigners, they will \\nbe paid in U.S. currency rather than foreign currency. This relieves the U.S. from the requirement to sell \\nproducts abroad to acquire sufficient foreign currency to repay its debts. Many other countries that have \\nexperienced international debt crises have had great problems financing interest and principal \\nrepayments especially when bad economic times make it difficult to maintain foreign sales.  \\nFinally, it is worth noting that, despite the name applied to it, our international “debt” position does not \\ncorrespond entirely to “debt” in the term’s common usage. Recall that debt commonly refers to \\nobligations that must be repaid with interest in the future. Although a sizable share of our outstanding \\nobligations is in the form of debt, another component is in equities. That means some of the money \\n“owed” to foreigners is simply the value of their shares of stock in U.S. companies. These equities either \\nwill make money or will not be based on the success of the business, but they do not require a formal \\nobligation for repayment in the future. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The IIP measures the difference between the total value of domestic holdings of foreign assets \\nand the value of foreign assets held in the domestic country.

Debt involves an obligation to repay principal and \\ninterest, whereas equities involve either profit or loss to the foreign asset holder. \\n• The U.S. IIP stands at $3.5 trillion in 2008, making the United States the largest debtor nation in \\nthe world. \\nEXERCISE  \\n1.

Recognize that trade deficits are not inherently bad and trade surpluses are not inherently good \\nfor a country. \\nThere is a popular and pervasive myth about international trade. The myth, simply stated, is that trade \\ndeficits are bad and trade surpluses are good. Good or bad for whom, one might ask? Well, for the entire \\ncountry. \\nThe presence of a trade deficit, or an increase in the trade deficit in a previous month or quarter, is  \\ncommonly reported as a sign of distress. Similarly, a decrease in a trade deficit, or the presence of or \\nincrease in a trade surplus, is commonly viewed as a sign of strength in an economy.  \\nUnfortunately, these perceptions and beliefs are somewhat misguid ed. In general, it is simply not true \\nthat a trade deficit is a sign of a weak economy and a trade surplus is a sign of a strong economy. Merely \\nknowing that a country has a trade deficit, or that a trade deficit is rising, is not enough information to say  \\nanything about the current or future prospects for a country— and yet that is precisely how the statistics \\nare often reported. \\nThe truth about trade deficits is that sometimes they are good, sometimes they are bad, but most times, \\nthey are benign (i.e., they just don’t matter). There are situations in which trade deficits could be \\ninterpreted as a sign of a strong thriving economy. There are other situations in which trade deficits could \\nbe indicative of economic problems. In most situations, however, trade deficits are not large enough to \\nwarrant a positive or negative interpretation. In this case, they should be viewed without interest. These \\nsame points apply to trade surpluses as well. \\nThe purpose of this chapter is to explain, clearly and intuitively, the circumstances in which trade \\nimbalances should be interpreted as good and the circumstances in which they are bad. The section will \\nshow situations in which trade deficits can indeed lead to long-term harm for an economy. However, it \\nwill also show cases in which trade deficits significantly improve a country’s long-term economic \\nprospects. We will highlight cases in which trade surpluses are appropriate and a sign of strength for a \\ncountry, and we will show other cases in which trade surpluses may corre spond to current demise or even \\nan eventual collapse of an economy.

Learn why trade deficits may not be related to job losses in a country. \\nOne of the main reasons trade deficits are considered deleterious is because of a common argument that \\ntrade deficits result in job losses. The rationale behind this argument is simple and convincing. There are \\ntwo parts to the story that begin with the definition of a trade deficit.  \\nFirst, a trade deficit arises whenever imports exceed exports. One simple reason for an imbalance of this \\nkind is that imports are too large or at least larger than they would be under balanced trade. The most \\ncommon reason offered in developed countries for why imports are too large is that low import prices \\narise because less-developed countries have exceedingly low wages paid to workers, lax health and safety \\nstandards, or more lenient environmental policies, all of which contribute to a veritable flood of imports.  \\nThe effect of excessive imports is said to be the purchase of cheaper foreign goods by domestic consumer s \\nrather than purchasing the slightly more expensive domestic varieties. As demand for domestic firms’ \\nproducts falls, these firms are forced to downsize, resulting in the layoff of domestic workers. Thus it is \\nsaid that trade deficits cause the loss of domestic jobs. \\nThe second story argues that the reason imports exceed exports is because exports are too low; they are \\nsmaller than they should be. The most common reason given for low exports, especially in the developed \\ncountries, is the relatively high barriers to trade in developing countries. Although many countries \\nparticipate in the World Trade Organization (WTO), the average applied tariffs still remain considerably \\nhigher in developing countries. \\nThe effect of insufficient exports is that products that could be produced and sold abroad are not \\nproduced and sold abroad because of the barriers to trade. If the barriers were only removed, then exports \\nwould expand and jobs would be created in the country. \\nThus since both of these stories can operate simultaneously, most observers are convinced that trade \\ndeficits indeed will cause job losses. Turn the deficit around, perhaps so much so as to induce a trade \\nsurplus, and this logic suggests that more jobs will be created. \\nThis argument is very convincing because there is an element of truth to it. Changes in import and export \\npatterns will certainly have competitive impacts on some industries and could produce temporary job \\nlosses.

Nor does it mean that increases in a country’s trade deficit will necessarily \\nlead to economy-wide job losses. \\nOne reason job losses may not occur has to do with the deceptive nature of the previous job loss stories. \\nThe stories are convincing as far as they go, but unfortunately, they don’t go far enough. In other words, \\nthe job loss stories have some validity, but they are incomplete; they don’t tell the full story, and as a \\nresult they tend to mislead. \\nThe rest of the story (as Paul Harvey would have said) is to recognize that when trade deficits arise on the \\ncurrent account, there is an equal and opposite trade surplus on the financial account of the bala nce of \\npayments. A financial account surplus means that foreigners are purchasing domestic assets. Some of \\nthese purchases consist of equities such as stocks and real estate, while other asset purchases involve the \\nlending of money as when foreigners purchase a government bond. In any case, that money flows back \\ninto the deficit country and ultimately is spent by someone. That someone could be the previous holder of \\nthe real estate or it could be the domestic government. When it is spent, it creates demands  for goods and \\nservices that in turn create jobs in those industries. \\nNow consider for a moment the following thought experiment. Suppose we could instantly change the \\nbehavior of the foreign lenders generating the financial account surplus (and the relate d trade deficit). \\nSuppose they decide at once not to lend the money to the government or not to purchase real estate but \\ninstead decide to purchase domestic goods. The increase in goods purchases by foreigners would imply \\nthat export demand and hence exports will rise. Indeed, they will rise sufficiently to eliminate the trade \\ndeficit. And because of the increase in exports, jobs will be created in the export industries. However, at \\nthe same time export jobs are created, other jobs in the economy are being lost. That’s because now less \\nmoney is there to purchase the real estate or to lend to the government. Thus the elimination of the trade \\ndeficit doesn’t create jobs in the aggregate, but it will change which sectors have more and less demand for \\nits products. In other words, changes in the trade deficit will ultimately affect only where the jobs are in \\nthe economy (i.e., in which industries), not how many jobs there are.  \\nThe one exception to this, and one of the main reasons the job loss stories remain so c onvincing, is when \\nthere are rapid changes in the trade deficit or surplus.

Understand the long-term implications of trade imbalances. \\n2. Identify conditions under which trade imbalances are detrimental, beneficial, or benign. \\nIn this section, a series of simple scenarios (or stories) are presented to demonstrate how the well -being of \\na country may be affected when it runs a trade imbalance. The scenarios compare national output with \\ndomestic spending over two periods of time under alternative assumptions about the country’s trade \\nimbalance and its economic growth rate between the two periods. After each aggr egate scenario is \\npresented, we also provide an analogous situation from the point of view of an individual. Finally we \\npresent an evaluation of each scenario and indicate countries that may be displaying similar trade \\npatterns. \\nTwo periods are used as a simple way to introduce the dynamic characteristics of trade imbalances. The \\namount of time between the two periods can be varied to provide alternative interpretations. Thus the two \\nperiods could be labeled as today andtomorrow, this year and next year, or this generation and next \\ngeneration. \\nWe assume that all trade imbalances correspond to debt obligations or IOUs (i.e., I owe you). In other \\nwords, the financial account imbalances that offset the trade imbalances will be interpreted as \\ninternational borrowing and lending rather than, say, foreign direct investment flows or real estate \\npurchases. \\nAfterward, we will comment on how the interpretations of these scenarios may change with the \\nalternative type of asset flow. \\nNational welfare is best measured by the amount of goods and services that are “consumed” by \\nhouseholds. What we care about, ultimately, is the standard of living obtainable by the average citizen, \\nwhich is affected not by how much the nation produces but by how much it consumes. \\nAlthough gross domestic product (GDP)is often used as a proxy for national welfare, it is an inadequate \\nindicator for many reasons, especially when a country runs trade imbalances. To quickly see why, \\nconsider the extreme situation in which a country runs the largest t rade surplus possible. This would arise \\nif a country exports all of its GDP and imports nothing.

The \\nstandard of living would be nonexistent. \\nTo avoid this problem we use domestic spending (DS), or the sum of domestic consumption, investment, \\nand government spending, as a proxy for national welfare. More formally, let  \\nDS = C + I + G, \\nwhere C, I, and G are defined as in the national income accounts. Recall from Chapter 2 \"National Income \\nand the Balance of Payments Accounts\" that C, I, and G each can be segmented into spending on \\ndomestically produced goods and services and spending on imported goods and services. Thus domestic \\nspending includes imported goods in the measure of national welfare. This is appropriate since imported \\ngoods are consumed by domestic citizens and add to their well-being and standard of living. \\nOne problem with using domestic spending as a proxy for average living standards is the inclusion of \\ninvestment (note that this problem would also arise using GDP as a proxy). Investment spending \\nmeasures the value of goods and services used as inputs into the productive process. As such, these items \\ndo not directly raise the well-being of citizens, at least not in the present period. To clarify this point, \\nconsider an isolated, self-sufficient corn farmer. Each year the farmer harvests corn, using part of it to \\nsustain the family during the year, while allocating some of the kernels to use as seed corn for the \\nfollowing year. Clearly, the more kernels the farmer saves for next year’s crop, the less corn the family will \\nhave to consume this year. As with the farmer, the same goes for the nation: the mor e that is invested \\ntoday, the lower will be today’s standard of living, ceteris paribus. Thus we must use domestic spending \\ncautiously as a measure of national welfare and take note of changes in investment spending if it occurs.  \\nThe analysis below will focus on the interpretation of differences between national income (GDP) and \\ndomestic spending under different scenarios concerning the trade imbalance. The relationship between \\nthem can be shown by rewriting the national income identity. \\nThe national income identity is written as \\nGDP = C + I + G + EX − IM. \\nSubstituting the term for domestic spending yields \\nGDP = DS + EX − IM, \\nand rearranging it gives \\nEX − IM = GDP − DS.

Overall, nothing very interesting happens in this case, but it will be useful for comparison \\npurposes. \\nThe Individual Analogy \\nConsider an individual named Rajiv. For an individual, GNP is analogous to Rajiv’s annual income since \\nhis income represents the value of goods and services produced with his labor services. Domestic \\nspending is analogous to the value of the goods and services purchased by Rajiv during the year. It \\ncorresponds to Rajiv’s consumption of goods and services that serves as a proxy for his welfare level. \\nTrade for an individual occurs whenever a transaction occurs with someone outside his household.  \\nLet’s assume for simplicity that Rajiv earns $30,000 per year. The assumption of no GNP growth in the \\nbase case implies that he continues to earn $30,000 in the second period and thus experiences no income \\ngrowth. The assumption of no trade imbalances implies that Rajiv engages in no borrowing or lending \\noutside of his household. That implies that he spends all of his income on consumption goods and thus \\npurchases $30,000 worth of goods and services. This level of consumption remains the same in both \\nperiods, implying that his standard of living is unchanged. \\nAnother way of interpreting balanced trade for an individual is to imagine that he exports $30,000 worth \\nof labor services and afterward imports $30,000 worth of consumption goods and services. Since e xports \\nequal imports, trade is balanced. \\nCase 2: Current Account Deficit Period 1; No GDP Growth between Periods \\nIn this case, we assume that the country runs a current account (or trade) deficit in the first period. We’ll \\nalso assume that the resultant financial account surplus corresponds to borrowing from the rest of the \\nworld, rather than asset purchases. These borrowed funds are assumed to be repaid in their entirety in the \\nsecond period. In other words, we’ll assume that loans are taken out in the first period and that the \\nprincipal and interest are repaid completely in the second period. We also assume that there is no GNP \\ngrowth between periods. \\nAs shown in Figure 3.3 \"Case 2\", the trade deficit in the first period implies that domestic spending, DS1, \\nexceeds GNP1. The difference between DS1 and GNP1represents the current account deficit as well as the \\nvalue of the outstanding principal on the foreign loans. The extra consumption the country can enjoy is \\npossible because it borrows funds from abroad and uses them to purchase extra imports.

The case \\nhighlights the fact that trade deficits, which arise from international borrowing, may require a reduced \\naverage standard of living for the country in the future when the loans must be repaid.  \\nAn example of this situation would be Mexico during the 1970s and 1980s. Mexico ran sizeable current \\naccount deficits in the 1970s as it borrowed liberally in international markets.  \\nIn the early 1980s, higher interest rates reduced its ability to fulfill its obligations to repay principal and \\ninterest on its outstanding loans. Their effective default precipitated the third world debt crisis of the \\n1980s. During the 1980s, as arrangements were made for an orderly, though incomplete, repayment of \\nMexico’s loans, the country ran sizeable current account surpluses. As in case two here, Mexico’s current \\naccount deficits in the 1970s allowed it to raise its average living standards, above what wou ld have been \\npossible otherwise, while its current account surpluses in the 1980s forced a substantial reduction in \\nliving standards. \\nIt is worth emphasizing that current account deficits are not detrimental in the periods in which the \\ndeficits are occurring. In fact, current account deficits correspond to higher consumption, investment, and \\ngovernment spending levels than would be possible under balanced trade. Instead, current account \\ndeficits pose a problem only when the debt repayment occurs, which is w hen the country is running \\ncurrent account surpluses.

Just as an individual may make a choice to substitute future consumption for present \\nconsumption, so might a nation. For example, an individual may reasonably decide while young to take \\nexotic vacations, engage in daredevilish activities, or maybe purchase a fast car, even if it means taking \\nout sizeable loans. Better to enjoy life while healthy, he may reason, even if it means that he will have to \\nforgo similar vacations or activities when he is older. Similarly, a nation, through an  aggregation of similar \\nindividual decisions, may “choose” to consume above its income today even though it requires reduced \\nconsumption tomorrow. As long as the future reduced consumption “costs” are borne by the individuals \\nwho choose to overconsume today, deficits for a nation need not be a problem. However, if the decision to \\noverconsume is made through excessive government spending, then the burden of reduced consumption \\ncould fall on the future generation of taxpayers, in which case there would be an intergenerational welfare \\ntransfer. \\nCase 3: Current Account Deficit Period 1; Positive GDP Growth between Periods \\nIn the third case, we assume, as in case two, that the country runs a trade deficit in the first period, that \\nthe trade deficit corresponds to borrowing from the rest of the world, and that in period two all the loans \\nare repaid with interest.

In a sense, the trade deficit has a similar long-term \\ndetrimental effect as in case two. \\nHowever, it is possible that the first period trade deficit, in this case, may actually be generating a long -\\nterm benefit. Suppose for a moment that this country’s balanced trade outcome over two periods would \\nlook like the base case. In that case, balanced trade prevails but no GDP growth occurs, leaving the \\ncountry with the same standard of living in both periods.

Assuming the \\neducational investment does not add to his consumption pleasures (a seemingly reasonable assumption \\nfor many students), his welfare is unaffected by the additional spending that occurs in period one. \\nHowever, his welfare is increased in period two since he is able to consume an additional $4,500 worth of \\ngoods and services even after paying back the student loans with interest.  \\n \\n \\nEvaluation  \\nThe lesson of case three is that trade deficits, even if large or persistent, will not cause long -term harm to a \\nnation’s average standard of living if the country grows rapidly enough.

If investment is necessary to fuel industrialization and economic \\ngrowth, as is often the case especially in early stages of development, an LDC might be forced to a slow or \\nnonexistent growth path if it restricts itself to balanced trade and limits its international borrowing.  \\nOn the other hand, if an LDC borrows money in international financial markets, it will run a trade deficit \\nby default.

Thus trade deficits can be a good thing for less -developed \\ncountries. \\nThe same lesson can be applied to the economies in transition in the former Soviet  bloc. These countries \\nsuffered from a lack of infrastructure and a dilapidated industrial base after the collapse of the Soviet \\nUnion. One obvious way to spur economic growth in the transition is to replace the capital stock with new \\ninvestment: build new factories, install modern equipment, improve the roads, improve \\ntelecommunications, and so on. However, with income falling rapidly after the collapse, there were few \\ninternal sources to fund this replacement investment. It was also not obvious which sect ors were the best \\nto invest in. Nevertheless, one potential option was for these countries to borrow funds on international \\nfinancial markets. Trade deficits that would occur under this scenario could be justified as an appropriate \\nway to stimulate rapid economic growth. \\nOf course, just because trade deficits can induce economic growth and generate long-term benefits for a \\ncountry doesn’t mean that a trade deficit will spur long-term economic growth. Sometimes investments \\nare made in inappropriate industries. Sometimes external shocks cause once profitable industries to \\ncollapse. Sometimes borrowed international funds are squandered by government officials and used to \\npurchase large estates and big cars.

The United States, for example, has had \\nrather large trade deficits since 1982. By the late 1980s, the United States achi eved the status of the \\nlargest debtor nation in the world. During the same period, domestic investment remained relatively low \\nespecially in comparison to other developed nations in the world.

The excess of exports over imports represents \\ngoods that could have been used for domestic consumption, investment, and government spending but \\nare instead being consumed by foreigners.

This corresponds \\nto the constant GDP in the above example. Rajiv would run a trade surplus in period one if he lends \\nmoney to others. One way to achieve this is simply to put money into a savings account in the local bank. \\nSuppose Rajiv deposits $5,000 into a savings account. That money is then used by the bank to make loans \\nto other individuals and businesses. Thus in essence Rajiv is making loans to them with the bank ac ting as \\nan intermediary. The $5,000 also represents money that Rajiv does not use to buy goods and services. \\nThus in period one Rajiv exports $30,000 of labor services, but imports only $25,000 of consumption \\ngoods. The excess is loaned to others so that they may be consumed instead in the first period. It is clear \\nthat Rajiv’s standard of living at $25,000 is lower in the first period than the $30,000 he could have \\nachieved had he not deposited money into savings. \\nIn the second period, we imagine that Rajiv again earns $30,000 and withdraws all the money plus \\ninterest from the savings account. Suppose he had earned 10 percent interest between the periods. In this \\ncase, his withdrawal would amount to $5,500. This means that in period two Rajiv can consume $35,500 \\nworth of goods and services. This outcome also implies that Rajiv’s domestic spending capability exceeds \\nhis income and so he must be running a trade deficit. In this case, Rajiv’s imports of goods and services at \\n$35,500 exceed his exports of $30,000 worth of labor services; thus he has a trade deficit. \\nIs this outcome good or bad for Rajiv? Most would consider this a good outcome. One might argue that \\nRajiv has prudently saved some of his income for a later time when he may have a greater need. The story \\nmay seem even more prudent if Rajiv suffered a significant drop in income in the second period to, say, \\n$20,000.

Few people would \\nadvise that one save so much as to put oneself into poverty or to reduce one’s living standard below some \\nreasonable norm. Excessive prudence can seem inappropriate as well.  \\nEvaluation \\nThe prime example of a country that mimics the first period of case four is Japan during the 1980s and \\n1990s. Japan ran sizeable trade surpluses during those two decades. As this story suggests, the flip side of \\nthe trade surplus is a financial account deficit that implied a considerable increase in the amount of loans \\nthat Japan made to the rest of the world. Although Japan’s trade surplus has often been touted as a sign of \\nstrength, an important thing to keep in mind is that Japan’s trade surpluses implied lower consumption \\nand government purchases, and thus a lower standard of living than would have been possible with \\nbalanced trade. Although trade surpluses can also result in lower investment, this effect was not apparent \\nfor Japan. During those two decades of investment, spending as a percentage of GDP always exceeded 25 \\npercent, higher than most other developed countries. \\nThese surpluses may turn out to be especially advantageous for Japan as it progresses in the twenty- first \\ncentury. First of all, it is clear that Japan’s surpluses did not usher in an era of continual and rapid GDP \\ngrowth. By the early 1990s, Japan’s economy had become stagnant and finally began to contract by 1998. \\nHowever, rather than allowing a decline in GDP to cause a reduction in living standards, Japan could use \\nits sizeable external savings surplus to maintain consumption at the level achieved previously. Of course, \\nthis would require that Japan increase its domestic consumption and begin to run a trade deficit, two \\nthings that did not occur even by 2009. \\nIn another respect, Japan’s trade surpluses may be advantageous over the longer run. Japan, along with \\nmost other developed nations, will experience a dramatic demographic shift over the next three decades. \\nIts retired population will continue to grow as a percentage of the total population of the baby boomers \\nreach retirement and people continue to live longer.

Of course, this outcome may never be realized if Japan’s economy \\ndoes not rebound strongly from its recent stagnant condition. \\nOverall, regardless of the outcome, Japan’s economy today, faced with a potentially severe recession, is \\ncertainly in a stronger position by virtue of its accumulated foreign savings than it would be if it had run \\ntrade deficits during the past two decades. \\nSummary \\nThese stories suggest that trade imbalances, when evaluated in terms of their momentary effects and their \\nlong-term economic consequences, can be either good, bad, or benign, depending on the circumstances.  \\nTrade deficits may signal excessive borrowing that could in the future lead to possible default, or worse, \\nan excessive reduction in living standards needed to repay the accumulated debt.

Here, the trade deficit is either \\nimmaterial or even beneficial in that the nation is able to achieve a higher current living standard because \\nof the deficit. Trade deficits might also make an expansion of domestic investment possible, which could \\nspur future economic growth sufficiently to make repayment consistent with growing living standards. In \\nthis case, trade deficits are clearly good as they stimulate future economic prosperity. Finally, in a free \\nmarket economy, trade deficits may simply reflect the aggregated choices of many individuals to forgo \\nfuture consumption to achieve more current consumption. In this case, the trade deficit should be viewed \\nas immaterial since it merely reflects the free choices of the nation’s people. \\nOn the other hand, a trade surplus may correspond to prudent foreign saving and purchases of foreign \\nproductive assets, which may be used to support a growing retired population in the future. In this case, \\nthe trade surplus is a good thing for the nation. The trade surplus might also represent a period of \\nrepayment of past debt.

As such, it is a better way to \\nmeasure the “consumption” in an economy affecting the nation’s standard of living as compared \\nto “production” or GDP. \\n• When a country has a current account deficit, its national consumption exceeds its national \\nproduction. When a country has a current account surplus, its national production exceeds its \\nnational consumption. \\n• Trade deficits become a problem over time if accumulated borrowings result in a substantial \\nreduction in consumption and standard of living for its citizens during the repayment periods. \\n• The problems associated with a deficit occur not when the trade deficit is being run but in later \\nperiods when a trade surplus becomes necessary. \\n• Trade deficit problems are mitigated with GNP growth.

Recognize how the long-term consequences of trade deficits change when they are financed by \\nequity rather than debt. \\nThe analysis of trade imbalances is further complicated by the fact that not all financial flows are debt \\nobligations or IOUs (i.e., I owe you). In the previous stories, we assumed that all financial account \\ntransactions corresponded to international lending or borrowing. In actuality, many international asset \\ntransactions involve sales or purchases of productive assets. For example, if a foreigner purchases shares \\nof Microsoft stock in the U.S. market, the transaction would be recorded as a credit entry on the financial \\naccount and would add to a financial account surplus. However, in this case we could not claim that \\nsomeone in the United States borrowed money from the rest of the world because there is no obligation to \\nrepay principal and interest in the future. Instead the foreign purchaser of the U.S. asset has purchased an \\nownership claim in a U.S. corporation that entitles him to the future stream of divide nds plus capital gains \\nif he sells the stock later at a higher price. If the company is profitable in the future, then the investors will \\nearn a positive return. However, if the company suffers economic losses in the future, then the dividends \\nmay be discontinued and the stock’s price may fall. Alternatively, the U.S. dollar could experience a \\nsignificant depreciation. The end result could be losses for the foreign investor and a negative rate of \\nreturn. In either case the foreign investor is not “entitled” to a return of his original investment or any \\nadditional return beyond. This same type of relationship arises for international real estate transactions \\nand for foreign direct investment, which occurs when a foreign firm substantially owns and operates a \\ncompany in another country. \\nTo the extent that financial account flows correspond to asset purchases without repayment obligations, \\nthe stories above change somewhat. For example, suppose a country runs a trade deficit in period one and \\nsuppose further that the resulting financial account surplus corresponds to foreign purchases of U.S. real \\nestate and businesses. In the first period, a country’s standard of living could be raised above what is \\npossible with balanced trade— not by borrowing money but by selling ownership claims on productive \\nassets. In the second period, the country’s standard of living need not be reduced since there is no \\nrepayment obligation.

In that period he is ab le to buy \\nmore than his income because he has divested some of his previously accumulated wealth. In the \\nfollowing period, he can once again make purchases equal to his income and thus need not suffer a \\nreduction in his living standards. \\nThe implication here is that nondebt asset flows may be less problematic than international loans because \\nthey do not require a reduction in living standards in the future. Of course, in this case, there is an \\nadditional concern that the country that sells off its assets may also be losing control of its productive \\nassets and thus its citizens will not be the ones to earn positive returns on these domestic activities. This \\nconcern should be tempered for a few reasons. First, foreign-owned firms remain subject to the laws of \\nthe domestic country. Countries can prevent exorbitant profit taking by applying profit taxes. What’s \\nmore, the foreign owners do not enjoy voting privileges and thus have less say over laws that might affect \\nthem. Second, foreign-owned firms generate employment opportunities for domestic citizens, and that \\nserves to benefit the country. Finally, owners of firms, whether foreign or domestic, are generally \\nmotivated by similar desires— namely, to make the business successful—  and successful businesses \\ngenerally benefit the owners, the employees, and the consumers of the product.  \\nAs an example, consider the purchase in the 1980s of Rockefeller Center in New York City by a group of \\nJapanese investors. Rockefeller Center is a centrally located building in New York City whose owners lease \\noffice space to businesses that wish to locate their offices there. Any owner of the building must compete \\nwith other businesses leasing office space throughout the city and thus must provide as high a quality and \\nas low a price as possible. If the owners manage the property well and provide quality services, then they \\nwill have a lot of tenants and they will make a profit. If they provide poor services, then businesses will \\nmove out and the owners will lose money. Thus it really shouldn’t matter to the tenants whether the \\nowners are American or Japanese, only whether they are good managers of the office space. Similarly, the \\nowners, regardless of nationality, will hire workers to maintain the facilities. These workers will benefit if \\nthe management is good and will suffer if it is poor, regardless of the owners’ nationality. Finally, if the \\nowners of the building are successful, then they deserve to earn a profit or return on their investment. If \\nthey provide poor services at high prices, then they will deserve to make a loss. Indeed, it shouldn’t matter \\nto anyone whether the owners are American or Japanese nationals.  \\nKEY TAKEAWAY  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Identify the conditions determining when a nation’s trade imbalance is good, bad, or benign. \\nReview of Trade Imbalance Interpretations \\nA quick reading of business and financial newspapers and magazines often reveals a number of \\nmisunderstandings about economic relationships. One of the most notable is the widespread conviction \\nthat trade deficits are a troubling economic condition that indicates weakness in an economy, while trade \\nsurpluses are a sign of strength for an economy. Although these beliefs are well founded in some \\ncircumstances, they are not valid as a general principle. A careful look at the implications of trade \\nimbalances reveals that trade deficits can, at times, be an indicator of rising economic stature, while trade \\nsurpluses can be associated with economic disaster. In many other cases, perhaps most, trade imbalances \\nare simply benign— that is, they do not represent a serious threat or imply a notable benefit. \\nThere are several reasons why misunderstandings about trade imbalances persist. The first problem \\nrelates to the terminology. A deficit, regardless of the context, sounds bad. To say that a business’s books \\nare in deficit, that a government’s budget is in deficit, or that a country’s trade balance is in deficit, simply \\nsounds bad. A surplus, in contrast, sounds pretty good. For a business, clearly we’d prefer a surplus, to be \\nin the black, to make a profit. Likewise, a budget surplus or a trade surplus must be good as well. \\nLastly, balance seems either neutral or possibly the ideal condition worth striving for. From an \\naccountant’s perspective, balance is often the goal. Debits must equal credits, and the books must balance. \\nSurely, this terminology must contribute to the confusion, at least in a small way, but it is not accurate in \\ndescribing trade imbalances in general. \\nA second reason for misunderstandings, especially with regard to deficits, may be a sense of injustice or \\ninequity because foreigners are unwilling to buy as many of our goods as we buy of theirs. Fairness would \\nseem to require reciprocity in international exchanges and therefore balanced trade. This \\nmisunderstanding could be easily corrected if only observers were aw are that a country’s balance of \\npayments, which includes trade in goods, services, and assets, is always in balance. There are no unequal \\nexchanges even when a country runs a trade deficit. \\nA third reason for the misunderstanding is that trade deficits are indeed bad for some countries in some \\nsituations while surpluses are sometimes associated with good economic outcomes.

One could also look at the very high growth rates of Japan in the 1980s and China in \\nthe last few decades for examples of countries with large trade surpluses that have seemingly fared very \\nwell. \\nHowever, despite these examples, one should not conclude that any country that has a trade deficit or \\nwhose trade deficit is rising is necessarily in a potentially dangerous situation; nor should we think that \\njust because a country has a trade surplus that it is necessarily economically healthy. To see why, we must \\nrecognize that trade imbalances represent more than just an imbalance in goods and services trade.  \\nAny imbalance in goods and services trade implies an equal and opposite imbalance in asset trade. When \\na country runs a trade deficit (more exhaustively labeled a current account deficit), it is also running a \\nfinancial account surplus; similarly, a trade surplus corresponds to a financial account deficit. Imbalances \\non the financial account mean that a country is a net seller of international assets (if a financial account \\nsurplus) or a net buyer of international assets (if a financial account deficit).  \\nOne way to distinguish among good, bad, or benign trade imbalances is to recognize the circumstances in \\nwhich it is good, bad, or benign to be a net international borrower or lender, a net purchaser, or seller of \\nownership shares in businesses and properties. \\nThe International Investment Position \\nAn evaluation of a country’s trade imbalance should begin by identifying the country’s net international \\nasset or investment position. The investment position is like a balance sheet in that it shows the total \\nholdings of foreign assets by domestic residents and the total holdings of domestic assets by foreign \\nresidents at a point in time. In the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) financial statistics, these are \\nlisted as domestic assets (foreign assets held by domestic residents) and domestic liabilities (domestic \\nassets owned by foreign residents). In contrast, the financial account balance is more like an income \\nstatement that shows the changes in asset holdings during the past year. In other words, the international \\nasset position of a country consists of stock variables while the financial account balance consists of flow \\nvariables. \\nA country’s net international investment balance may either be in a debtor position, a creditor position, or \\nin balance. If in a creditor position, then the value of foreign assets (debt and equity) held by domestic \\nresidents exceeds the value of domestic assets held by foreigners.

If the reverse is true, so that domestic liabilities to foreigners \\nexceed domestic assets, then the country would be called a debtor nation.  \\nAsset holdings may consist of either debt obligations or equity claims. Debt consists of IOUs in which two \\nparties sign a contract agreeing to an initial transfer of money from the lender to the borrower followed by \\na repayment according to an agreed schedule. The debt contract establish es an obligation for the borrower \\nto repay principal and interest in the future. Equity claims represent ownership shares in potentially \\nproductive assets. Equity holdings do not establish obligations between parties, at least not in the form of \\nguaranteed repayments. Once ownership in an asset is transferred from seller to buyer, all advantages and \\ndisadvantages of the asset are transferred as well. \\nDebt and equity obligations always pose several risks. The first risk with debt obligations is the risk of \\npossible default (either total or partial). To the lender, default risk means that the IOU will not be repaid \\nat all, that it will be repaid only in part, or that it is repaid over a much longer period than originally \\ncontracted. To the borrower, the risk of default is that future borrowing will likely become unavailable. In \\ncontrast, the advantage of default to the borrower is that not all the borrowed money is repaid.  \\nThe second risk posed by debt is that the real value of the repayments may be different t han expected. \\nThis can arise because of unexpected inflation or unexpected currency value changes. Consider inflation \\nfirst. If inflation is higher than expected, then the real value of debt repayment (if the nominal interest \\nrate is fixed) will be lower than originally expected. This will be an advantage to the borrower (debtor), \\nwho repays less in real terms, and a disadvantage to the lender (creditor), who receives less in real terms. \\nIf inflation turns out to be less than expected, then the advantages are reversed. \\nNext, consider currency fluctuations. Suppose a domestic resident, who receives income in the domestic \\ncurrency, borrows foreign currency in the international market. If the domestic currency depreciates, then \\nthe value of the repayments in domestic currency terms will rise even though the foreign currency \\nrepayment value remains the same. Thus currency depreciations can be harmful to borrowers of foreign \\ncurrency. A similar problem can arise for a lender. Suppose a domestic resident purchases foreign \\ncurrency and then lends it to a foreign resident (note in this case the domestic resident is saving money \\nabroad).

If the market is vibrant and management is good, then the investment will be \\nprofitable. Otherwise, the rate of return on the investment could be negativ e; the foreign investor could \\nlose money. In this case, all the risk is borne by the investor, however.

As with debt, equity purchases can suffer from exchange \\nrate risk as well. When foreign equities are purchased, their rate of return in terms of domestic currency \\nwill depend on the currency value. If the foreign currency in which assets  are denominated falls \\nsubstantially in value, then the value of those assets falls along with it.  \\nFour Trade Imbalance Scenarios \\nThere are four possible situations that a country might face. It may be  \\n1. a debtor nation with a trade deficit, \\n2. a debtor nation with a trade surplus, \\n3. a creditor nation with a trade deficit, \\n4. a creditor nation with a trade surplus. \\nFigure 3.6 \"International Asset Positions\" depicts a range of possible international investment positions. \\nOn the far left of the image, a country would be a net debtor nation, while on the far right, it would be a \\nnet creditor nation. A trade deficit or surplus run in a particular year will cause a change in the nation’s \\nasset position assuming there are no capital gains or losses on net foreign investments. A trade deficit \\nwould generally cause a leftward movement in the nation’s investment position implying either a \\nreduction in its net creditor position or an increase in its net debtor position. A trade surplus would cause \\na rightward shift in a country’s investment position implying either an increase in its net creditor position \\nor a decrease in its net debtor position. \\nAn exception to this rule occurs whenever there are changes in the market value of foreign assets and \\nwhen \\nthe \\ninvestm\\nFigure 3.6 International Asset Positions \\n \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

For example, suppose a \\ncountry has balanced trade in a particular year and is a net creditor nation. If the investment position is \\nevaluated using original cost, then since the current account is balanced, there would be no change in the \\ninvestment position. However, if the investment position is evaluated at current market values, th en the \\nposition can change even with balanced trade. In this case, changes in the investment position arise due to \\ncapital gains or losses. Real estate or property valuations may change, portfolio investments in stock \\nmarkets may rise or fall, and currency value changes may also affect the values of national assets and \\nliabilities. \\nThe pros and cons of a national trade imbalance will depend on which of the four situations describes the \\ncurrent condition of the country. We’ll consider each case in turn next. \\nCase 1: Net Debtor Nation Running a Current Account Deficit \\nThis is perhaps the most common situation in the world, or at least this type of case gets the most \\nattention. The main reason is that large trade deficits run persistently by countries, which ar e also large \\ndebtor nations, can eventually be unsustainable. Examples of international debt crises are widespread. \\nThey include the third world debt crisis of the early 1980s, the Mexican crisis in 1994, and the Asian crisis \\nin 1997. \\nHowever, not all trade deficits nor all debtor countries face eventual default or severe economic \\nadjustment. Indeed, for some countries, a net debtor position with current account deficits may be an \\nideal economic situation. To distinguish the good cases from the bad requires  us to think about situations \\nin which debt is good or bad. \\nAs mentioned earlier, a current account deficit means that a country is able to spend more on goods and \\nservices than it produces during the year. The additional spending can result in increases i n consumption, \\ninvestment, and/or government spending. The country accomplishes this as a net debtor country by \\nborrowing from the rest of the world (incurring debt), or by selling some of its productive assets \\n(equities). \\nLet’s consider a few scenarios. \\nFirst, suppose the current account deficit is financed by borrowing money from the rest of the world (i.e., \\nincurring debt). Suppose the additional spending over income is on consumption and government goods \\nand services.

This would enhance the nation’s average standard of living \\nduring the period the deficit is being run. The disadvantage is that the loans that fin ance the increase in \\nthe standard of living must be repaid in the future. During the repayment period, the country would run a \\ncurrent account surplus, resulting in national spending below national income. This might require a \\nreduction in the country’s average standard of living in the future. \\nThis scenario is less worrisome if the choices are being made by private citizens. In this case, individuals \\nare freely choosing to trade off future consumption for current consumption. However, if the additional \\nspending is primarily on government goods and services, then it will be the nation’s taxpayers who will be \\nforced to repay government debt in the future by reducing their average living standards. In other words, \\nthe future taxpayers’ well-being will be reduced to pay for the extra benefits accruing to today’s taxpayers. \\nPossible reductions in future living standards can be mitigated or eliminated if the economy grows \\nsufficiently fast. If national income is high enough in the future, then average living stand ards could still \\nrise even after subtracting repayment of principal and interest. Thus trade deficits are less worrisome \\nwhen both current and future economic growth are more rapid.  \\nOne way to stimulate economic growth is by increasing spending on domestic  investment. If the borrowed \\nfunds that result when a country runs a current account deficit are used for investment rather than \\nconsumption or if the government spending is on infrastructure, education, or other types of human and \\nphysical capital, then the prospects for economic growth are enhanced. \\nIndeed, for many less-developed countries and countries in transition from a socialist to capitalist market, \\ncurrent account deficits represent potential salvation rather than a curse. Most poor countries suff er from \\nlow national savings rates (due to low income) and inadequate tax collection systems. One obvious way to \\nfinance investment in these countries is by borrowing from developed countries that have much higher \\nnational savings rates. As long as the investments prove to be effective, much more rapid economic \\ngrowth may be possible. \\nThus trade deficits for transitional and less-developed economies are not necessarily worrisome and may \\neven be a sign of strength if they are accompanied by rising domestic i nvestment and/or rising \\ngovernment expenditures on infrastructure. \\nThe main problem with trade deficits arises when they result in a very large international debt position. \\n(Arguably, one could claim that international debt greater than 50 percent of GDP i s very large.)

However, the \\ninternational debt position figures include both debt and equities, and only the debt can be defaulted on. \\nEquities, or ownership shares, may yield positive or negative returns but do not represent the same type \\nof contractual obligations. A country would never be forced to repay foreign security holders for its losses \\nsimply because its value on the market dropped. Thus a proper evaluation of the potential for default \\nshould only look at the net international “debt” position after excluding the net position on equities. \\nDefault becomes more likely the larger the external debt relative to the countries’ ability to repay. Ability \\nto repay can be measured in several ways. First, one can look at net debt relative to GDP. Since it \\nmeasures annual national income, GDP represents the size of the pool from which repayment of principal \\nand interest is drawn— the larger the pool, the greater the ability of the country to repay. Alternatively, the \\nlower the country’s net debt to GDP ratio, the greater the country’s ability to repay. \\nA second method to evaluate ability to repay is to consider net debt as a percentage of exports of goods \\nand services. This is especially relevant when international debt is denominated in foreign currencies. In \\nthis case, the primary method to acquire foreign currencies to make repayment of debt is through the \\nexport of goods and services. (The alternative method is to sell domestic assets.) Thus the potential for \\ndefault may rise if the country’s ratio of net external debt to exports is larger. \\nNotice, though, that the variable to look at to evaluate the risk of default is the net debt position,  not the \\ntrade deficit. The trade deficit merely reveals the change in the net debt position during the past year and \\ndoes not record total outstanding obligations. In addition, a trade deficit can be run even while the net \\n“debt” position falls. This could occur if the trade deficit is financed primarily with net equity sales rather \\nthan net debt obligations. Thus the trade deficit, by itself, does not reveal a complete picture regarding the \\npotential for default. \\nNext, we should consider what problems are associated with default. Interestingly, it is not really default \\nitself that is immediately problematic but the actions taken to avoid default. If default on international \\ndebt does occur, international relationships with creditor countries would generally suffer. Foreign ban ks \\nthat are not repaid on past loans will be reluctant to provide loans in the future. For a less -developed \\ncountry that needs foreign loans to finance productive investment, these funds may be cut off for a long \\nperiod and thus negatively affect the country’s prospects for economic growth.

Thus the country enjoys the benefits of greater spending during the previous perio ds when trade \\ndeficits are run but does not have to suffer the consequences of debt repayment. With regard to the \\ncountry’s international debt position, default would cause an immediate discrete reduction in the \\ncountry’s debt position. \\nThe real problem arises when economic shocks suddenly raise external obligations on principal and \\ninterest, making a debt that was once sustainable suddenly unsustainable. In these cases, it is the effort \\nmade to avoid default that is the true source of the problem.  \\nInability to repay foreign debt arises either if the value of payments suddenly increases or if the income \\nused to finance those payments suddenly falls. Currency depreciations are a common way in which the \\nvalue of repayments can suddenly rise. If foreign debt is denominated in foreign currency, then domestic \\ncurrency depreciation implies an appreciation in the value of external debt. If the currency depreciation is \\nlarge enough, a country may become suddenly unable to make interest and principal repayments. Note,  \\nhowever, that if external debt were denominated in domestic currency, then the depreciation would have \\nno effect on the value of interest and principal repayments. This implies that countries with large external \\ndebts are in greater danger of default if (1) their currency value is highly volatile and (2) the external debt \\nis largely denominated in foreign currency. \\nA second way in which foreign interest obligations can suddenly rise is if the obligations have variable \\ninterest rates and if the interest rates suddenly rise. This was one of the problems faced by third world \\ncountries during the debt crisis in the early 1980s. Loans received from the U.S. and European banks \\ncarried variable interest rates to reduce the risk to the banks from unexpected inflati on. When restrictive \\nmonetary policy in the United States pushed up U.S. interest rates, interest obligations by foreign \\ncountries also suddenly rose. Thus international debt with variable interest rates potentially raises the \\nlikelihood of default. \\nDefault can also occur if a country’s ability to repay suddenly falls. This can occur if the country enters \\ninto a recession. Recessions imply falling GDP, which reduces the pool of funds available for repayment. If \\nthe recession is induced by a reduction in exports, perhaps because of recessions in major trading partner \\ncountries, then the ability to finance foreign interest and principal repayments is reduced. Thus a \\nrecession in the midst of a large international debt position can risk potential default on int ernational \\nobligations.

The problem, really, is that the country might suddenly have to begin running current \\naccount surpluses to maintain repayments of its international obligations. Remember that trade deficits \\nmean that the country can spend more than its income. By itself, that’s a good thing. Current account \\nsurpluses, though, mean that the country must spend less than its income. That’s the bad thing, especially \\nif it occurs in the face of an economic recession. \\nIndeed, this is one of the problems the U.S. economy is facing in the midst of the current recession. As the \\nU.S. GDP began to fall in the fall of 2008, the U.S. trade deficit also fell. For the “trade deficits are bad” \\nfolks, this would seem to be a good thing. However, it really indicated that not only was U.S. production \\nfalling but, because its trade deficit was also falling, its consumption was falling even faster. In terms of \\nstandard of living, the drop in the U.S. trade deficit implied a worsening of the economic conditions of its \\ncitizens. \\nHowever, since this problem arises only when a net debtor country runs a current account surplus, we’ll \\ntake up this case in the next section.

Alternatively, foreigners \\nmay be divesting themselves of domestic equity assets (i.e., selling previously purchased equities, like \\nstocks and real estate, back to domestic residents). In either case, the trade surplus will reduce the \\ncountry’s net debtor position and will require that domestic spending is less than national income. This \\ncase is especially problematic if it arises because currency depreciation has forced a sudden change in the \\ncountry’s required repayments on international debt. This is the outcome when a series of trade deficits \\nproves to be unsustainable. What unsustainability means is that the deficits can no longer be continued. \\nOnce external financing is no longer available, the country would not have the option to roll over past \\nobligations. In this case, in the absence of default, the country’s net repayment on current debt would rise \\nand push the financial account into deficit and hence the trade account into surplus. \\nWhen this turnaround occurs rapidly, the country suddenly changes from a state in which it spends more \\non consumption, investment, and government than its income to a state in which it spends less on these \\nitems than its income. Even if GDP stayed the same, the country would suffer severe reductions in its \\nstandard of living and reductions in its investment spending. The rapid reduction in domestic demands is \\ngenerally sufficient to plunge the economy into a recession as well. This reduction in GDP further \\nexacerbates the problem. \\nThis problematic outcome is made worse nationally when most of the debt repayment obligations are by \\nthe domestic government or if the external obligations are government-backed. A government that must \\nsuddenly make larger than expected repayments of debt must finance it either by raising taxes or by \\nreducing government benefits. The burden of the repayment is then borne by the general population \\nbecause it must all come from taxpayers.

If \\ndomestic investment falls as a result, future growth prospects for the country are reduced as well. This \\nsituation has been a problem in Russia and other transition economies. As these economies increased \\ntheir private ownership of assets, a small number of people became extremely wealthy. In a well -\\nfunctioning economy with good future business prospects, wealth is often invested internally helping to \\nfuel domestic growth. However, in many transition economies, wealth holders decided that it was too \\nrisky to invest domestically because uncertainty about future growth potential was very low. So instead, \\nthey saved their money abroad, essentially financing investment in much healthier and less risky \\neconomies. \\nChina is another creditor country running a trade surplus today. It is, however, in a different situation \\nthan Russia or the transition economies in the 1990s. China’s internal investment rate is very high and its \\ngrowth rate has been phenomenal over the past twenty years or more. The fact that it has a trade surplus \\nmeans that as a nation it is saving even more than necessary to finance its already high investment levels. \\nThe excess it is lending abroad, thereby raising its international creditor position. (SeeChapter 1 \\n\"Introductory Finance Issues: Current Patterns, Past History, and International Institutions\" for more \\ndetails.)

With domestic investment kept high, \\nthe cost of the large surpluses must be felt as a reduction in consumption and government spending. In \\nthis case, a large trade surplus leads to a reduction in average living standards for the country. This is a \\npoint worth emphasizing. Countries that run trade surpluses suffer a reduction in living standards, not an \\nincrease, relative to the case of balanced trade. \\nAnother potential problem with being a net creditor country is the risk associated with international \\nlending and asset purchases. First of all, foreign direct investments may not pay off as hoped or expected. \\nPortfolio investments in foreign stock markets can suddenly be reduced in value if the foreign stock \\nmarket crashes. On international loans, foreign nations may default on all or part of the outstanding \\nloans, may defer payments, or may be forced to reschedule payments. This is a more likely event if the \\noutstanding loans are to foreign countries with national external debts that may prove unsustainable. If \\nthe foreign country suffers rapid currency depreciation and if the foreign loans are denominated in \\ndomestic currency, then the foreign country may be forced to default. Defau lts may also occur if the \\nforeign debtor countries suffer severe recessions. The creditor nation in these cases is the one that must \\nsuffer the losses. \\nIt was this situation that was especially serious for the United States at the onset of the third world debt \\ncrisis in the early 1980s. At that time, a number of large U.S. banks had a considerable proportion of their \\nasset portfolios as loans to third world countries. Had these countries defaulted en masse, it would have \\nthreatened the solvency of these banks and could have led to a serious banking crisis in the U.S. economy.  \\nAlternatively, suppose the surplus country has made external loans in the foreign countries’ currency. If \\nthe foreign currency depreciates, even if only gradually, then the value of the  foreign assets falls in terms \\nof the domestic currency. The realized rates of return on these assets could then become negative, falling \\nfar short of returns on comparable domestic assets. \\nThis is the dilemma that China faces today. The Chinese government  has accumulated almost $1 trillion of \\nU.S. Treasury bonds as a result of its persistent current account surpluses over the past decade. All of this \\ndebt is denominated in U.S. dollars, making it subject to exchange rate risk.

Essentially, this \\ndescribes a country that is drawing down previously accumulated savings. The deficit also implies that the \\ncountry is spending more than its income. This situation is especially good if it allows the country to \\nmaintain living standards during a recession. This case would also be good if a country with a rapidly \\naging population is drawing down previous savings to maintain average living standards.  \\nThe current account deficit can cause problems if as in case one, the deficit corresponds to falling \\ninvestment and increases in consumption and government expenditures. If these changes occur while the \\neconomy continues to grow, then it may indicate potential problems for future economic growth. \\nHowever, if the same changes occur while the economy is in a recession, then the effect would be to \\nmaintain average living standards by drawing down external savings. If this occurs only during the \\nrecession, then the long-term effect on growth would be mitigated.

This can occur if the credits are exceedingly large or denominated in foreign \\ncurrency. \\n• Trade surpluses are more worrisome when they arise suddenly in association with a large \\ninternational debtor position. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Learn who participates in foreign exchange markets and why. \\nThe foreign exchange market (Forex) is not a market like the New York Stock Exchange, where daily \\ntrades of stock are conducted in a central location. Instead, the Forex refers to the activities of major \\ninternational banks that engage in currency trading. These banks act as intermediaries between the true \\nbuyers and sellers of currencies (i.e., governments, businesses, and individuals). These banks will hold \\nforeign currency deposits and stand ready to exchange these for domestic currency upon demand. The \\nexchange rate (ER) will be determined independently by each bank but will essentially be determined by \\nsupply and demand in the market. In other words, the bank sets the exchange rate at each moment to \\nequalize its supply of foreign currency with the market demand. Each bank makes money by collecting a \\ntransactions fee for its “exchange services.” \\nIt is useful to categorize two distinct groups of participants in the Forex,  those whose transactions are \\nrecorded on the current account (importers and exporters) and those whose transactions are recorded on \\nthe financial account (investors). \\nImporters and Exporters \\nAnyone who imports or exports goods and services will need to exchange currencies to make the \\ntransactions. This includes tourists who travel abroad; their transactions would appear as services in the \\ncurrent account. These businesses and individuals will engage in currency trades daily; however, these \\ntransactions are small in comparison to those made by investors. \\nInternational Investors, Banks, Arbitrageurs, and Others \\nMost of the daily currencies transactions are made by investors. These investors, be they investment \\ncompanies, insurance companies, banks, or others, are making currency transactions to realize a greater \\nreturn on their investments or holdings. Many of these companies are responsible for managing the \\nsavings of others. Pension plans and mutual funds buy and sell billions of dollars worth of assets dail y. \\nBanks, in the temporary possession of the deposits of others, do the same. Insurance companies manage \\nlarge portfolios that act as their capital to be used to pay off claims on accidents, casualties, and deaths. \\nMore and more of these companies look internationally to make the most of their investments.

Only about $60 to $100 billion of trade in goods and services take s place \\ndaily worldwide. This suggests that many of the currency exchanges are done by international investors \\nrather than importers and exporters. \\nInvestment Objectives \\nInvestors generally have three broad concerns when an investment is made. They care ab out how much \\nmoney the investment will earn over time, they care about how risky the investment is, and they care \\nabout how liquid, or convertible, the asset is. \\n1. Rate of return (RoR). The percentage change in the value of an asset over some period. \\nInvestors purchase assets as a way of saving for the future. Anytime an asset is purchased, the purchaser \\nis forgoing current consumption for future consumption. To make such a transaction worthwhile the \\ninvestors hope (sometimes expect) to have more money for future consumption than the amount they give \\nup in the present. Thus investors would like to have as high a rate of return on their investments as \\npossible. \\nExample 1: Suppose a Picasso painting is purchased in 1996 for $500,000. One year later, the painting  is \\nresold for $600,000. The rate of return is calculated as: \\n[(600,000 – 500,000))/ 500,000] x 100 = (100,000/500,000) x 100 = 0.20 x 100 = 20%  \\nExample 2: $1,000 is placed in a savings account for one year at an annual interest rate of 10 percent. \\nThe interest earned after one year is $1,000 × 0.10 = $100. Thus the value of the account after one year is \\n$1,100. The rate of return is:  \\n(1100 – 1000 / 1000) x 100 = (100/1000) x 100 = 0.10 x 100 = 10% \\nThis means that the rate of return on a domestic interest-bearing account is merely the interest rate. \\n2. Risk. The second primary concern of investors is the riskiness of the assets. Generally, the greater the \\nexpected rate of return, the greater the risk. Invest in an oil wildcat endeavor and you might get a 1,000 \\npercent return on your investment— that is, if you strike oil. The chances of doing so are likely to be very \\nlow, however. Thus a key concern of investors is how to manage the trade-off between risk and return. \\n3. Liquidity. Liquidity essentially means the speed with which assets can be converted to cash.

Learn some of the basic definitions regarding currency markets and exchange rates. \\nAnyone who has ever traveled to another country has probably had to deal with an exchange rate between \\ntwo currencies. (I say “probably” because a person who travels from, say, Italy to Spain continues to use \\neuros.) In a sense, exchange rates are very simple. However, despite their simplicity they never fail to \\ngenerate confusion. To overcome that confusion this chapter begins by offering straightforward \\ndefinitions and several rules of thumb that can help with these problems.  \\nThe exchange rate (ER) represents the number of units of one currency that exchanges for a unit of \\nanother. There are two ways to express an exchange rate between two currencies (e.g., between the U.S. \\ndollar [$] and the British pound [£]). One can either write $/£ or £/$. These  are reciprocals of each other. \\nThus if E is the $/£ exchange rate and V is the £/$ exchange rate, then E = 1/V. \\nFor example, on January 6, 2010, the following exchange rates prevailed:  \\nE$/£ = 1.59, which implies V£/$ = 0.63, \\nand \\nV¥/$ = 92.7, which implies E$/¥ = 0.0108. \\nCurrency Value \\nIt is important to note that the value of a currency is always given in terms of another currency. Thus the \\nvalue of a U.S. dollar in terms of British pounds is the £/$ exchange rate. The value of the Japanese yen in \\nterms of dollar is the $/¥ exchange rate. \\nNote that we always express the value of all items in terms of something else. Thus the value of a quart of \\nmilk is given in dollars, not in quarts of milk. The value of car is also given in dollar terms, not in terms of \\ncars. Similarly, the value of a dollar is given in terms of something else, usually another currency. Hence, \\nthe rupee/dollar exchange rate gives us the value of the dollar in terms of rupees.  \\nThis definition is especially useful to remember when one is dealing with unfamiliar currencies. Thus the \\nvalue of the euro (€) in terms of British pounds is given as the £/€ exchange rate.  \\nSimilarly, the peso/euro exchange rate refers to the value of the euro in terms of pesos.  \\nCurrency appreciation means that a currency appreciates with respect to another when its value rises in \\nterms of the other. The dollar appreciates with respect to the yen if the ¥/$ exchange rate rises.

The dollar depreciates with respect to the yen if the ¥/$ \\nexchange rate falls. \\nNote that if the ¥/$ rate rises, then its reciprocal, the $/¥ rate, falls. Since the $/¥ rate represents the \\nvalue of the yen in terms of dollars, this means that when the dollar appreciates with respect to the yen, \\nthe yen must depreciate with respect to the dollar. \\nThe rate of appreciation (or depreciation) is the percentage change in the value of a currency over some \\nperiod. \\nExample 1: U.S. dollar (US$) to the Canadian dollar (C$) \\nOn January 6, 2010, EC$/US$ = 1.03. \\nOn January 6, 2009, EC$/US$ = 1.19. \\nUse the percentage change formula, (new value − old value)/old value: \\n(1.03-1.19)/1.19 = -0.16 / 1.19 = -0.134 \\nMultiply by 100 to write as a percentage to get \\n−0.134 × 100 = −13.4%. \\nSince we have calculated the change in the value of the U.S. dollar in terms of Canadian dollar, and since \\nthe percentage change is negative, this means that the dollar has depreciated by 13.4 percent with respect \\nto the C$ during the previous year. \\nExample 2: U.S. dollar ($) to the Pakistani rupee (R) \\nOn January 6, 2010, ER/$ = 84.7. \\nOn January 6, 2010, ER/$ = 79.1. \\nUse the percentage change formula, (new value − old value)/old value: \\n \\n(84.7 – 79.1) / 79.1 = +5.6 / 79.1 = +0.071 \\nMultiply by 100 to write as a percentage to get \\n+0.071 × 100 = +7.1%. \\nSince we have calculated the change in the value of the U.S. dollar, in terms of rupees, and since the \\npercentage change is positive, this means that the dollar has appreciated by 7.1 percent with respect to the \\nPakistani rupee during the past year.

Currency arbitrage means buying a currency in one market (e.g., New York) at a \\nlow price and reselling, moments later, in another market (e.g., London) at a higher price.  \\nThe spot exchange rate refers to the exchange rate that prevails on the spot, that is, for trades to take place \\nimmediately. (Technically, it is for trades that occur within two days.)  \\nThe forward exchange rate refers to the rate that appears on a contract to exchange currencies either 30, \\n60, 90, or 180 days in the future. \\nFor example, a corporation might sign a contract with a bank to buy euros for U.S. dollars sixty days from \\nnow at a predetermined ER. The predetermined rate is called the sixty -day forward rate. Forward \\ncontracts can be used to reduce exchange rate risk. \\nFor example, suppose an importer of BMWs is expecting a shipment in sixty days. Suppose that upon \\narrival the importer must pay €1,000,000 and the current spot ER is 1.20 $/€.  \\nThus if the payment were made today it would cost $1,200,000. Suppose further that the importe r is \\nfearful of a U.S. dollar depreciation. He doesn’t currently have the $1,200,000 but expects to earn more \\nthan enough in sales over the next two months. If the U.S. dollar falls in value to, say, 1.30 $/€ within \\nsixty days, how much would it cost the importer in dollars to purchase the BMW shipment? \\nThe shipment would still cost €1,000,000. To find out how much this is in dollars, multiply €1,000,000 \\nby 1.30 $/€ to get $1,300,000. \\nNote that this is $100,000 more for the cars simply because the U.S. doll ar value changed. \\nOne way the importer could protect himself against this potential loss is to purchase a forward contract to \\nbuy euros for U.S. dollars in sixty days. The ER on the forward contract will likely be different from the \\ncurrent spot ER. In part, its value will reflect market expectations about the degree to which currency \\nvalues will change in the next two months. Suppose the current sixty-day forward ER is 1.25 $/€, \\nreflecting the expectation that the U.S. dollar value will fall. If the import er purchases a sixty-day contract \\nto buy €1,000,000, it will cost him $1,250,000 (i.e., $1,000,000 × 1.25 $/€). Although this is higher than \\nwhat it would cost if the exchange were made today, the importer does not have the cash available to make \\nthe trade today, and the forward contract would protect the importer from an even greater U.S. dollar \\ndepreciation.

If the reverse were true, such that the forward trade were cheaper than a spot \\ntrade, then there is a forward discount. \\nA currency trader is hedging if he or she enters into a forward contract to protect oneself from a downside \\nloss. However, by hedging the trader also forfeits the potential for an upside gain. Suppose in the story \\nabove that the spot ER falls rather than rises. Suppose the ER fell to 1.10 $/€. In this case, had the \\nimporter waited, the €1,000,000 would only have cost $1,100,000 (i.e., $1,000,000 × 1.10 $/€).  Thus \\nhedging protects against loss but at the same time eliminates potential unexpected gain.  \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• An exchange rate denominated x/y gives the value of y in terms of x. When an exchange rate \\ndenominated x/y rises, then y has appreciated in value in terms ofx, while x has depreciated in \\nterms of y. \\n• Spot exchange rates represent the exchange rate prevailing for currency trades today. Forward, \\nor future, exchange rates represent the exchange values on trades that will take place in the \\nfuture to fulfill a predetermined contract. \\n• Currency arbitrage occurs when someone buys a currency at a low price and sells shortly \\nafterward at a higher price to make a profit. \\n• Hedging refers to actions taken to reduce the risk associated with currency trades. \\nEXERCISE S  \\n1.

Learn how to calculate the rate of return (RoR) for a domestic deposit and a foreign deposit. \\nSuppose that an investor holding U.S. dollars must decide between two investments of equal risk and \\nliquidity. Suppose one potential investment is a one-yearcertificate of deposit (CD) issued by a U.S. bank \\nwhile a second potential investment is a one-year CD issued by a British bank. For simplicity we’ll assume \\nthat interest is calculated on both CDs using a simple interest rather than with a compounding formula. A \\nCD is a type of deposit that provides a higher rate of interest to the depositor in return for a promise to \\nkeep the money deposited for a fixed amount of time. The time period could be six months, one year, two \\nyears, or any other period decided by the bank. If the depositor wants to withdraw the money earlier, she \\nmust pay a penalty. \\nSince we imagine that an investor wants to obtain the highest rate of return (RoR) possible, given \\nacceptable risk and liquidity characteristics, that investor will choose the investment with the highest rate \\nof return. If the investor acted naively, she might simply compare interest rates between the two \\ninvestments and choose the one that is higher. However, this would not necessarily be the best choice. To \\nsee why, we need to walk through the calculation of rates of return on these two investments.  \\nFirst, we need to collect some data, which we will do in general terms rather than use specific values. \\nExamples with actual values are presented in a later section.  \\n \\nLet E$/£ = the spot ER.E$/£e = the expected ER one year from now.i$ = the one-year interest rate on a CD \\nin the United States (in decimal form).i£ = the one-year interest rate on a CD in Britain (in decimal form). \\nU.S. Rate of Return \\nThe rate of return on the U.S. CD is simply the interest rate on that deposit. More formally,  \\nRoR$ = i$. \\nThis is because the interest rate describes the percentage increase in the value of the deposit over the \\ncourse of the year. It is also simple because there is no need to convert currencies.  \\nBritish Rate of Return \\nThe rate of return on the British CD is more difficult to determine. If a U.S. investor, with dollars, wants to \\ninvest in the British CD, she must first exchange dollars for pounds on the spot market and then use the \\nBritish pound (£) to purchase the British CD.

The rate of return on that investment is the percentage change in \\ndollar value during the year. To calculate this we can follow the procedure below.  \\nSuppose the investor has P dollars to invest (P for principal). \\nStep 1: Convert the dollars to pounds. \\nP/ E$/£   \\nis the number of pounds the investor will have at the beginning of the year.  \\n Step 2: Purchase the British CD and earn interest in pounds during the year.  \\n(P/ E$/£)(1+i£) \\nis the number of pounds the investor will have at the end of the year. The first term in parentheses returns \\nthe principal. The second term is the interest payment. \\n Step 3: Convert the principal plus interest back into dollars in one year.  \\n(P/E$/£) (1+i£) Ee$/£ \\nis the number of dollars the investor can expect to have at the end of the year.  \\nThe rate of return in dollar terms from this British investment can be found by calculating the expected \\npercentage change in the value of the investor’s dollar assets over the year, as shown below: \\nRoR£=    P/ E$/£(1+i£) Ee\\n$/£−P \\n   P \\nAfter factoring out the P, this reduces to   \\nRoR£=  Ee\\n$/£ (1+i£)−1  \\n             E$/£ \\nThus the rate of return on the foreign investment is more complicated because the set of transactions is \\nmore complicated. For the U.S. investment, the depositor simply deposits the dollars and earns dollar \\ninterest at the rate given by the interest rate. However, for the foreign deposit, the investor must first \\nconvert currency, then deposit the money abroad earning interest in foreign cu rrency units, and finally \\nreconvert the currency back to dollars. The rate of return depends not only on the foreign interest rate but \\nalso on the spot exchange rate and the expected exchange rate one year in the future.  \\nNote that according to the formula, the rate of return on the foreign deposit is positively related to \\nchanges in the foreign interest rate and the expected foreign currency value and negatively related to the \\nspot foreign currency value. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Mathematically, a term \\ndoes not change in value if you add and subtract the same value:  \\n \\nRoR£= Ee$/£ +i£  Ee$/£ −1+i£−i£ \\n              E$/£             E$/£ \\n \\nStep 3: Change the (−1) in the expression to its equivalent, −E$/£/E$/£.  Also change −i£ to its \\nequivalent, −i£ (E$/£/E$/£).  Since\\n \\n−E$/£/E$/£ = 1, these changes do not change the value of the \\nrate of return expression: \\nRoR£=Ee$/£ +i£ Ee$/£ − E$/£+ i£−i£ E$/£ \\n             E$/£              E$/£         E$/£                  E$/£ \\nStep 4: Rearrange the expression: \\n \\nRoR£= i£ + Ee$/£ - E$/£ + i£ Ee$/£−i£ E$/£ \\n               E$/£        E$/£              E$/£          E$/£ \\nStep 5: Simplify by combining terms with common denominators:\\n  \\n \\nRoR£= i£ + Ee$/£ - E$/£ + i£ Ee$/£ - E$/£ \\n                     E$/£                 E$/£   \\n \\nStep 6: Factor out the percentage change in the exchange rate term:  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Similarly, if  (Ee$/£−E$/£ ) / E$/£\\n \\nwere negative, then it \\ncorresponds to the expected rate of depreciation of the pound during the subsequent year.  \\nThe expected rate of change in the pound value is multiplied by (1 +  i£), which generally corresponds to a \\nprincipal and interest component in a rate of return calculation. \\nTo make sense of this expression, it is useful to consider a series of simple numerical examples. \\nSuppose the following values prevail, \\ni£ 5% per year \\nEe$/£ 1.1 $/£ \\nE$/£ 1.0 $/£ \\nPlugging these into the rate of return formula yields   \\nRoR£=0.05+(1+0.05)1.10−1.00,∞ \\n    1.00 \\nwhich simplifies to \\nRoR£ = 0.05 + (1 + 0.05) × 0.10 =.155 or 15.5%. \\nNote that because of the exchange rate change, the rate of return on the British asset is considerably \\nhigher than the 5 percent interest rate. \\nTo decompose these effects suppose that the British asset yielded no interest whats oever. \\nThis would occur if the individual held pound currency for the year rather than purchasing a CD.

Remember that \\narbitrage means buying something when its price is low, selling it when its price is high, and thus making \\na profit on the series of transactions. In this case, the investor buys pounds at the start of the year, when \\ntheir price (in terms of dollars) is low, and then resells them at the end of the year when their price is \\nhigher. \\nNext, suppose that there was no exchange rate change during the year, but there was a 5 percent interest \\nrate on the British asset. In this case, the rate of return becomes \\nRoR£ = 0.05 + (1 + 0.05) × 0.0 =.05 or 5%. \\nThus with no change in the exchange rate, the rate of return reduces to the inter est rate on the asset. \\nFinally, let’s look back at the rate of return formula: \\n \\nRoR£= i£ + (1+ i£)  Ee$/£ - E$/£  \\n                             E$/£  \\nThe first term simply gives the contribution to the total rate of return that derives solely from the interest \\nrate on the foreign asset.

In this case, the principal that is originally deposited will  \\ngrow in value by the percentage exchange rate change.

Define the interest rate parity condition. \\n2. Learn the asset approach to exchange rate determination. \\nInterest rate parity (IRP) is a theory used to explain the value and movements of exchange rates. It is also \\nknown as the asset approach to exchange rate determination. The  interest rate parity theory assumes that \\nthe actions of international investors— motivated by cross-country differences in rates of return on \\ncomparable assets— induce changes in the spot exchange rate. In another vein, IRP suggests that \\ntransactions on a country’s financial account affect the value of the exchange rate on the foreign exchange \\n(Forex) market. This contrasts with the purchasing power parity theory, which assumes that the actions of \\nimporters and exporters, whose transactions are recorded on the current account, induce changes in the \\nexchange rate. \\nInterest Rate Parity Condition \\nInterest rate parity refers to a condition of equality between the rates of return on comparable assets \\nbetween two countries. The term is somewhat of a misnomer on the basis of how it is being described \\nhere, as it should really be called rate of return parity. The term developed in an era when the world was \\nin a system of fixed exchange rates. Under those circumstances, and as will be demonstrated in a later \\nchapter, rate of return parity did mean the equalization of interest rates. However, when exchange rates \\ncan fluctuate, interest rate parity becomes rate of return parity, but the name was never changed.  \\nIn terms of the rates of return formulas developed in Chapter 4 \"Foreign Exchange Markets and Rates of \\nReturn\", interest rate parity holds when the rate of return on dollar deposits is just equal to the expected \\nrate of return on British deposits, that is, when   RoR$ = RoR£. \\nPlugging in the above formula yields \\n \\ni$ = i£ + (1+i£) Ee$/£−E$/£ \\n          E$/£ \\nThis condition is often simplified in many textbooks by dropping the final term in which the British \\ninterest rate is multiplied by the exchange rate change. The logic is that the final term is usually very small \\nespecially when interest rates are low. The approximate version of the IRP condition then is ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The approximate version would not be a good approximation when \\ninterest rates in a country are high. For example, back in 1997, short -term interest rates were 60 percent \\nper year in Russia and 75 percent per year in Turkey. With these interest rates, the approximate formula \\nwould not give an accurate representation of rates of return. \\nInterest Rate Parity Theory \\nInvestor behavior in asset markets that results in interest parity can also explain why the exchange rate \\nmay rise and fall in response to market changes. In other words, interest parity can be used to develop a \\nmodel of exchange rate determination. This is known as the asset approach,  or the interest rate parity \\nmodel. \\nThe first step is to reinterpret the rate of return calculations described previously in more general \\n(aggregate) terms. Thus instead of using the interest rate on a one-year certificate of deposit (CD), we will \\ninterpret the interest rates in the two countries as the average interest rates that currently prevail. \\nSimilarly, we will imagine that the expected exchange rate is the average expectation across many \\ndifferent individual investors. The rates of return then are the average expected rates of return on a wide \\nvariety of assets between two countries. \\nNext, we imagine that investors trade currencies \\nin the foreign exchange (Forex) market. Each \\nday, some investors come to a market ready to \\nsupply a currency in exchange for another, while \\nothers come to demand currency in exchange for \\nanother. \\nConsider the market for British pounds (£) in \\nNew York depicted in Figure 5.1 \"The Forex for \\nBritish Pounds\". We measure the supply and \\ndemand of pounds along the horizontal axis and \\nthe price of pounds (i.e., the exchange rate E$/£) \\non the vertical axis.

The supply is genera lly \\nby British investors who demand dollars to purchase dollar denominated assets. However, supply of \\npounds might also come from U.S. investors who decide to convert previously acquired pound currency. \\nLet D£ the demand for pounds in exchange for dollars at all different exchange rates that might prevail. \\nThe demand is generally by U.S. investors who supply dollars to purchase pound -denominated assets. Of \\ncourse, demand may also come from British investors who decide to convert previously purchased dollars . \\nRecall that \\n \\nRoR£ = i£ + (1+i£) Ee$/£−E$/£, \\n     E$/£ \\nwhich implies that as E$/£ rises, RoR£ falls. This means that British investors would seek to supply more \\npounds at higher pound values but U.S. investors would demand fewer pounds at higher pound values. \\nThis explains why the supply curve slopes upward and the demand curve slopes downward.  \\nThe intersection of supply and demand specifies the equilibrium exchange rate ( E1) and the quantity of \\npounds (Q1) traded in the market. When the Forex is at equilibrium, it must be that interest rate parity is \\nsatisfied. This is true because the violation of interest rate parity will cause investors to shift funds from \\none country to another, thereby causing a change in the exchange rate.

Learn how changes in interest rates and expected exchange rates can influence international \\ninvestment decisions and affect the exchange rate value. \\nComparative statics refers to an exercise in a model that assesses how changes in an exogenous variable \\nwill affect the values of the endogenous variables. The endogenous variables are those whose values are \\ndetermined in the equilibrium. In the IRP model, the endogenous variables are the exchange rate value \\nand— of lesser importance— the quantity of currencies exchanged on the Forex market. The exogenous \\nvariables are those whose values are given beforehand and are known by the model’s decision makers. In \\nthe IRP model, the exogenous variables are those that influence the positions of the rate of return curves, \\nincluding the U.S. interest rate, the British interest rate, and the expected future exchange rate. Another \\nway to describe this is that the endogenous variable values are determined within the model, while the \\nexogenous variable values are determined outside of the model.  \\nComparative statics exercises enable one to answer a question like “What would happen to the exchange \\nrate if there were an increase in U.S. interest rates?” When assessing a question like this, economists will \\ninvariably invoke the ceteris paribus assumption. Ceteris paribus means that we assume all other \\nexogenous variables are maintained at their original values when we change the variable of interes t. Thus \\nif we assess what would happen to the exchange rate (an endogenous variable) if there were an increase in \\nthe U.S. interest rate (an exogenous variable) while invoking ceteris paribus, then ceteris paribus means \\nkeeping the original values for the other exogenous variables (in this case, the British interest rate and the \\nexpected future exchange rate) fixed. \\nIt is useful to think of a comparative statics exercise as a controlled economic experiment. In the sciences, \\none can test propositions by controlling the environment of a physical system in such a way that one can \\nisolate the particular cause-and-effect relationship. Thus, to test whether a ball and a feather will fall at \\nthe same rate in a frictionless vacuum, experimenters could create a vacuu m environment and measure \\nthe rate of descent of the ball versus the feather. In economic systems, such experiments are virtually \\nimpossible because one can never eliminate all the “frictions.” \\nHowever, by creating mathematical economic systems (i.e., an economic model), it becomes possible to \\nconduct similar types of “experiments.” A comparative statics exercise allows one to isolate how a change ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Use the rate of return plots to represent the interest rate parity equilibrium in the foreign \\nexchange market. \\nAn alternative graphical approach is sometimes used to depict the equilibrium exchange rate in the \\nforeign exchange (Forex) market. The graph is called the rate of return diagram since it depicts rates of \\nreturn for assets in two separate countries as functions of the exchange rate. The equilibrium condition \\ndepicted in the diagram represents the interest rate parity condition. In effect, the diagram identifies the \\nequilibrium exchange rate that must prevail to satisfy the interest rate parity condition. \\nRecall the rate of return formulas for deposits in two separate countries. Consider an investor, holding \\nU.S. dollars, comparing the purchase of a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) at a U.S. bank with a one-\\nyear CD issued by a British bank. The rate of return on the U.S. deposit works out simply to be the U.S. \\ninterest rate shown below: \\n \\nRoR$ = i$. \\nThe rate of return on the British asset, however, is a more complicated formula that depends on the \\nBritish interest rate (i£), the spot exchange rate (E$/£), and the expected exchange rate (E$/£e). In its \\nsimplest form it is written as follows: \\n \\nRoR£=Ee$/£ (1+i£) – 1 \\n E$/£  \\nIn Figure 5.5 \"Rate of Return Diagram\", we plot both RoR equations with respect to the exchange rate ( E$/£). \\nSince RoR$ is not a function (i.e., not dependent) on the exchange rate, it is drawn as a vertical line at the \\nlevel of the U.S. interest rate (i$). This simply means that as the exchange rate rises or falls, \\nthe RoR$ always remains immutably fixed at the U.S. interest rate.

Indeed, the relationship is negative \\nsince E$/£ is in the denominator of the equation. \\nThis means that as E$/£rises, RoR£ falls, and vice \\nversa. \\nThe intuition behind this negative relationship is \\nobtained by looking at the alternative (equivalent) \\nformula for RoR£: \\n \\nRoR£= i£ + Ee$/£ - E$/£ (1+i£)  \\n               E$/£  \\nRecall that the exchange rate ratio represents the \\nexpected percentage change in the value of the \\npound. Suppose, as an example, that this term were positive. That would mean the investor believes the \\npound will appreciate during the term of the investment. Furthermore, since it is an expected \\nappreciation of the pound, it will add to the total rate of return on the British investment. Next, suppose \\nthe spot exchange rate (E$/£) rises today. Assuming ceteris paribus, as we always do in these exercises, the \\nexpected exchange rate remains fixed. That will mean the numerator of the exchange rate expression will \\nfall in value, as will the value of the entire expression. The interpretation of this change is that the \\ninvestor’s expected appreciation of the pound falls, which in turn lowers the overall rate of return. Hence, \\nwe get the negative relationship between the $/£ exchange rate and  RoR£. \\nThe intersection of the two RoR curves in the diagram identifies the unique exchange rate E′$/£ that \\nequalizes rates of return between the two countries. This exchange rate is in equilibrium because any \\ndeviations away from interest rate parity (IRP) will motivate changes in investor behavior an d force the \\nexchange back to the level necessary to achieve IRP.

Learn how adjustment to equilibrium is described in the interest rate parity model. \\nAny equilibrium in economics has an associated behavioral story to explain the forces that will move the \\nendogenous variable to the equilibrium value. In the foreign exchange (Forex) model, the endogenous \\nvariable is the exchange rate. This is the variable that is determined as a solution in the model and will \\nchange to achieve the equilibrium. Variables that do not change in the adjustment to the equilibrium are \\nthe exogenous variables. In this model, the exogenous variables are E$/£e, i$, and i£. Changes in the \\nexogenous variables are necessary to cause an adjustment to a new equilibrium. However, in telling an \\nequilibrium story, it is typical to simply assume that the endogenous variable is not at the equilibrium (for \\nsome unstated reason) and then explain how and why the variable will adjust to the equilibrium value. \\nExchange Rate Too High \\nSuppose, for some unspecified reason, the exchange rate is currently at E″$/£ as shown in Figure 5.6 \\n\"Adjustment When the Exchange Rate Is Too High\". The equilibrium exchange rate is at E′$/£ since at this \\nrate, rates of return are equal and interest rate parity (IRP) is satisfied. Thus at  E″$/£ the exchange rate is \\ntoo high. Since the exchange \\nrate, as written, is the value of \\nthe pound, we can also say that \\nthe pound value is too high \\nrelative to the dollar to satisfy \\nIRP. \\nWith the exchange rate at E″$/£, \\nthe rate of return on the \\ndollar, RoR$, is given by the \\nvalue A along the horizontal \\naxis. This will be the value of the \\nU.S. interest rate. The rate of \\nreturn on the pound, RoR£ is \\ngiven by the value B, however. \\nFigure 5.6 Adjustment When the Exchange Rate Is Too High \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Under this circumstance, higher returns on deposits \\nin the United States will motivate investors to invest funds in the United States rather than Britain. This \\nwill raise the supply of pounds on the Forex as British investors seek the higher average return on U.S. \\nassets. It will also lower the demand for British pounds (£) by U.S. investors who decide to invest at home \\nrather than abroad. Both changes in the Forex market will lower the value of the pound and raise the U.S. \\ndollar value, reflected as a reduction in E$/£. \\nIn more straightforward terms, when the rate of return on dollar deposits is higher than on Britis h \\ndeposits, investors will increase demand for the higher RoR currency and reduce demand for the other. \\nThe change in demand on the Forex raises the value of the currency whose RoR was initially higher (the \\nU.S. dollar in this case) and lowers the other currency value (the British pound). \\nAs the exchange rate falls from E″$/£ to E′$/£, RoR£ begins to rise up, from B to A. This occurs \\nbecause RoR£ is negatively related to changes in the exchange rate. Once the exchange rate falls \\nto E′$/£, RoR£ will become equal to RoR$ at A and IRP will hold. At this point there are no further pressures \\nin the Forex for the exchange rate to change, hence the Forex is in equilibrium at  E′$/£. \\nExchange Rate Too Low \\nIf the exchange rate is lower than the equilibrium rate, then the adjustment will proceed in the opposite \\ndirection. At any exchange rate below E′$/£ in the diagram,RoR£ > RoR$. This condition will inspire \\ninvestors to move their funds to Britain with the higher rate of return. The subsequent increase in the \\ndemand for pounds will raise the value of the pound on the Forex and  E$/£ will rise (consequently, the \\ndollar value will fall). The exchange rate will continue to rise and the rate of return on pounds will fall \\nuntil RoR£ = RoR$ (IRP holds again) at E′$/£. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• In the interest rate parity model, when the $/£ exchange rate is less than the equilibrium rate, \\nthe rate of return on British deposits exceeds the RoR on U.S. deposits. That inspires investors to \\ndemand more pounds on the Forex to take advantage of the higher RoR. Thus the $/£ exchange \\nrate rises (i.e., the pound appreciates) until the equilibrium is reached when interest rate parity \\nholds. \\n• In the interest rate parity model, when the $/£ exchange rate is greater than the equilibrium rate, \\nthe rate of return on U.S. deposits exceeds the RoR on British deposits.

In this model, the U.S. interest rate ( i$) and the \\nBritish interest rate (i£) both remain fixed as the expected exchange rate rises. \\nAn expected exchange rate increase means that if investors had expected the pound to appreciate, they \\nnow expect it to appreciate even more.

Identify the conditions under which the law of one price holds. \\n2. Identify the conditions under which purchasing power parity holds. \\nPurchasing power parity (PPP) is a theory of exchange rate determination and a way to compare the \\naverage costs of goods and services between countries. The theory assumes that the actions of importers \\nand exporters (motivated by cross-country price differences) induce changes in the spot exchange rate. In \\nanother vein, PPP suggests that transactions on a country’s current account affect the value of the \\nexchange rate on the foreign exchange (Forex) market. This is in contrast with the interest rate parity \\ntheory, which assumes that the actions of investors (whose transactions are recorded on the capital \\naccount) induce changes in the exchange rate. \\nPPP theory is based on an extension and variation of the “law of one price” as applied to the aggregate \\neconomy. To explain the theory it is best to first review the idea behind the law of one price.  \\nThe Law of One Price (LoOP) \\nThe law of one price says that identical goods should sell for the same price in two separate markets when \\nthere are no transportation costs and no differential taxes applied in the two markets. Consider the \\nfollowing information about movie video tapes sold in the U.S. and Mexican markets.  \\nPrice of videos in U.S. market (Pv$) \\n$20 \\nPrice of videos in Mexican market (Pvp) \\nP150 \\nSpot exchange rate (Ep/$) \\n10 P/$ \\nThe dollar price of videos sold in Mexico can be calculated by dividing the video price in pesos by the spot \\nexchange rate as show: \\n               \\nTo see why the peso price is divided by the exchange rate rather than multiplied, notice the conversion of \\nunits shown in the brackets.

Since the dollar price of the video is less than the dollar price in the United \\nStates, the law of one price does not hold in this circumstance.\\n \\nThe next question to ask is what might happen as a result of the discrepancy in prices. Well, as long as \\nthere are no costs incurred to transport the goods, there is a profit-making opportunity through trade. For \\nexample, U.S. travelers in Mexico who recognize that identical video titles are selling there for 25 percent \\nless might buy videos in Mexico and bring them back to the United States to sell. Th is is an example of \\n“goods arbitrage.” An arbitrage opportunity arises whenever one can buy something at a low price in one \\nlocation, resell it at a higher price, and thus make a profit. \\nUsing basic supply and demand theory, the increase in demand for videos in Mexico would push up the \\nprice of videos. The increase in supply of videos on the U.S. market would force the price down in the \\nUnited States. In the end, the price of videos in Mexico may rise to, say, p180 while the price of videos in \\nthe United States may fall to $18. At these new prices the law of one price holds since  \\n \\nThe idea in the law of one price is that identical goods selling in an integrated market in which there are \\nno transportation costs, no differential taxes or subsidies, and no tariffs or other trade barriers should sell \\nat identical prices. If different prices prevailed, then there would be profit -making opportunities by \\nbuying the good in the low price market and reselling it in the high price market. If entrepreneurs took \\nadvantage of this arbitrage opportunity, then the prices would converge to equality.  \\nOf course, for many reasons the law of one price does not hold even between markets within a country. \\nThe price of beer, gasoline, and stereos will likely be different in New Yo rk City and in Los Angeles. The \\nprice of these items will also be different in other countries when converted at current exchange rates. The \\nsimple reason for the discrepancies is that there are costs to transport goods between locations, there are \\ndifferent taxes applied in different states and different countries, nontradable input prices may vary, and \\npeople do not have perfect information about the prices of goods in all markets at all times. Thus to refer \\nto this as an economic “law” does seem to exaggerate its validity. \\nFrom LoOP to PPP \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If it makes sense from the law of one price that identical goods should sell for identical \\nprices in different markets, then the law ought to hold for all identical goods sold in both markets.  \\nFirst, let’s define the variable CB$ to represent the cost of a basket of goods in the United States \\ndenominated in dollars. For simplicity we could imagine using the same basket of goods used in the \\nconstruction of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI$). The consumer price index (CPI) uses a market \\nbasket of goods that are purchased by an average household during a s pecified period. The basket is \\ndetermined by surveying the quantity of different items purchased by many different households. One can \\nthen determine, on average, how many units of bread, milk, cheese, rent, electricity, and so on are \\npurchased by the typical household. You might imagine it’s as if all products are purchased in a grocery \\nstore with items being placed in a basket before the purchase is made.  CB$ then represents the dollar cost \\nof purchasing all the items in the market basket. We will similarly define CBp to be the cost of a market \\nbasket of goods in Mexico denominated in pesos. \\nNow if the law of one price holds for each individual item in the market basket, then it should hold for the \\nmarket baskets as well. In other words,  \\n \\nRewriting the right-hand side equation allows us to put the relationship in the form commonly used to \\ndescribe absolute purchasing power parity, which is \\n \\nIf this condition holds between two countries, then we would say PPP is satisfied. The condition says that \\nthe PPP exchange rate (pesos per dollar) will equal the ratio of the costs of the two market baskets of \\ngoods denominated in local currency units. Note that the reciprocal relationship is also \\nvalid. \\nBecause the cost of a market basket of goods is used in the construction of the country’s consumer price \\nindex, PPP is often written as a relationship between the exchange rate and the country’s price indices. \\nHowever, it is not possible merely to substitute the price index directly for the cost of the market basket \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn the relationship between the consumer price index and the PPP exchange rate. \\nThe consumer price index (CPI) is an index that measures the average level of prices of goods and services \\nin an economy relative to a base year. To track only what happens to prices,  the quantities of goods \\npurchased is assumed to remain fixed from year to year. This is accomplished by determining — with \\nsurvey methods— the average quantities of all goods and services purchased by a typical household during \\nsome period. The quantities of all of these goods together are referred to as the average market basket. For \\nexample, the survey might find that the average household in one month purchases 10 gallons of gas, 15 \\ncans of beer, 3.2 gallons of milk, 2.6 pounds of butter, and so on. The basket of goods would also contain \\nitems like health and auto insurance, housing services, utility services, and many other items. We can \\ndescribe the market basket easily as a collection or set of quantities (Q1, Q2, Q3,…,  Qn). Here Q1may be the \\nquantity of gasoline, Q2 the quantity of beer, and so on. The set has ndifferent quantity entries, implying \\nthat there are n different items in the market basket. \\nThe cost of the market basket is found by surveying the average prices for each of the n products in the \\nmarket in question. This survey would yield a collection or set of prices (P1, P2, P3,…,  Pn). The cost of the \\nmarket basket is then found by summing the product of the price and quantity for each item. That \\nis, CB = P1Q1 + P2Q2 + P3Q3 +…+  PnQn, or  \\n \\nThe first year in which the index is constructed is called the base year. Suppose 1982 is the base year for \\nthe United States. Let CBYY represent the cost of the market basket evaluated at the prices that prevail in \\nthe year (YY) (e.g., CB09 is the cost of a market basket evaluated in 2009 prices). The CPI is derived \\naccording to the following formula: \\n \\nwhere CPIYY is the CPI in the year (YY). The term is multiplied by 100 by convention, probably because it \\nreduces the need to use digits after a decimal point.

Learn how adjustment to equilibrium occurs in the PPP model. \\nThe purchasing power parity (PPP) relationship becomes a theory of exchange rate determination by \\nintroducing assumptions about the behavior of importers and exporters in response to changes in the \\nrelative costs of national market baskets. Recall the story of the law of one price, when the price of a good \\ndiffered between two countries’ markets and there was an incentive for profit-seeking individuals to buy \\nthe good in the low price market and resell it in the high price market. Similarly, if a market bas ket \\ncontaining many different goods and services costs more in one market than another, we should likewise \\nexpect profit-seeking individuals to buy the relatively cheaper goods in the low -cost market and resell \\nthem in the higher-priced market. If the law of one price leads to the equalization of the prices of a good \\nbetween two markets, then it seems reasonable to conclude that PPP, describing the equality of market \\nbaskets across countries, should also hold. \\nHowever, adjustment within the PPP theory occurs with a twist compared to adjustment in the law of one \\nprice story. In the law of one price story, goods arbitrage in a particular product was expected to affect the \\nprices of the goods in the two markets. The twist that’s included in the PPP theory is that arbitrage, \\noccurring across a range of goods and services in the market basket, will affect the exchange rate rather \\nthan the market prices. \\nPPP Equilibrium Story \\nTo see why the PPP relationship represents an equilibrium, we need to tell an equilibrium story. An \\nequilibrium story in an economic model is an explanation of how the behavior of individuals will cause the \\nequilibrium condition to be satisfied. The equilibrium condition is the PPP equation written as   \\n \\nThe endogenous variable in the PPP theory is the exchange rate. Thus we need to explain why the \\nexchange rate will change if it is not in equilibrium. In general there are always two versions of an \\nequilibrium story, one in which the endogenous variable (Ep/$ here) is too high and one in which it is too \\nlow. \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Let’s consider the case in which the exchange rate is too low to be in \\nequilibrium. This means that \\n \\nwhere Ep/$ is the exchange rate that prevails on the spot market. Since it is less than the ratio of the market \\nbasket costs in Mexico and the United States, it is also less than the PPP exchange rate. The right side of \\nthe expression is rewritten to show that the cost of a market basket in the United States evaluated in pesos \\n(i.e., CB$Ep/$) is less than the cost of the market basket in Mexico also evaluated in pesos. Thus it is \\ncheaper to buy the basket in the United States, or in other words, it is more profitable to sell items in the \\nmarket basket in Mexico. \\nThe PPP theory now suggests that the cheaper basket in the United States will lead to an increase in \\ndemand for goods in the U.S. market basket by Mexico. As a consequence, it will increase the demand for \\nU.S. dollars on the \\nforeign exchange \\n(Forex) market. \\nDollars are needed \\nbecause purchases of U.S. \\ngoods require U.S. \\ndollars. Alternatively, U.S. \\nexporters will realize that \\ngoods sold in the \\nUnited States can be sold \\nat a higher price in \\nMexico. If these goods are \\nsold in pesos, the U.S. \\nexporters will want to \\nconvert the proceeds back \\nto dollars. Thus there is an increase in U.S. dollar demand (by Mexican importers) and an increase in peso \\nsupply (by U.S. exporters) on the Forex.

At the same time, Mexican consumers would refrain from \\npurchasing the more expensive U.S. goods. This would lead to a reduction in demand for dollars in \\nexchange for pesos on the Forex. Hence, the demand curve for dollars shifts to the left. Due to the demand \\ndecrease and the supply increase, the exchange rate (Ep/$) falls. This means that the dollar depreciates and \\nthe peso appreciates. \\nExtra demand for pesos will continue as long as goods and services remain cheaper in Mexico. However, \\nas the peso appreciates (the dollar depreciates), the cost of Mexican goods rises relative to U.S. goods. The \\nprocess ceases once the PPP exchange rate is reached and market baskets  cost the same in both markets. \\nAdjustment to Price Level Changes under PPP \\nIn the PPP theory, exchange rate changes are induced by changes in relative price levels between two \\ncountries. This is true because the quantities of the goods are always presumed  to remain fixed in the \\nmarket baskets. Therefore, the only way that the cost of the basket can change is if the goods’ prices \\nchange. Since price level changes represent inflation rates, this means that differential inflation rates will \\ninduce exchange rate changes according to the theory. \\nIf we imagine that a country begins with PPP, then the inequality given in equilibrium story 1, \\ncan arise if the price level rises in Mexico (peso inflation), if the price level falls in the \\nUnited States (dollar deflation), or if Mexican inflation is more rapid than U.S. inflation. According to the \\ntheory, the behavior of importers and exporters would now induce a dollar appreciation and a peso \\ndepreciation. In summary, an increase in Mexican prices relative to the chan ge in U.S. prices (i.e., more \\nrapid inflation in Mexico than in the United States) will cause the dollar to appreciate and the peso to \\ndepreciate according to the purchasing power parity theory. \\nSimilarly, if a country begins with PPP, then the inequality given in equilibrium story 2, \\ncan arise if the price level rises in the United States (dollar inflation), the price level falls in Mexico (peso \\ndeflation), or if U.S. inflation is more rapid than Mexican inflation. In this case, the inequality would \\naffect the behavior of importers and exporters and induce a dollar depreciation and peso appreciation. In \\nsummary, more rapid inflation in the United States would cause the dollar to depreciate while the peso \\nwould appreciate. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Identify the reasons why the PPP condition is rarely satisfied between two countries. \\n2. Learn the dynamic version of PPP. \\nProblems with the PPP Theory \\nThe main problem with the purchasing power parity (PPP) theory is that the PPP condition is rarely \\nsatisfied within a country. There are quite a few reasons that can explain this and so, given the logic of the \\ntheory, which makes sense, economists have been reluctant to discard the theory on the ba sis of lack of \\nsupporting evidence. Below we consider some of the reasons PPP may not hold.  \\nTransportation costs and trade restrictions. Since the PPP theory is derived from the law of one price, the \\nsame assumptions are needed for both theories. The law of one price assumes that there are no \\ntransportation costs and no differential taxes applied between the two markets. These mean that there can \\nbe no tariffs on imports or other types of restrictions on trade. Since transport costs and trade restrictions \\ndo exist in the real world, this would tend to drive prices for similar goods apart. Transport costs should \\nmake a good cheaper in the exporting market and more expensive in the importing market. Similarly, an \\nimport tariff would drive a wedge between the prices of an identical good in two trading countries’ \\nmarkets, raising it in the import market relative to the export market price. Thus the greater \\ntransportation costs and trade restrictions are between countries, the less likely for the costs of market \\nbaskets to be equalized. \\nCosts of nontradable inputs. Many items that are homogeneous nevertheless sell for different prices \\nbecause they require a nontradable input in the production process.

This contrasts with the interest rate parity theory in \\nwhich the behavior of investors seeking the highest rates of return on investments motivates adjustments \\nin the exchange rate.

Since absolute PPP suggests that the exchange rate may \\nrespond to inflation, we can imagine that the exchange rate would change in a systematic way given that a \\ncontinual change in the price level (inflation) is occurring. \\nIn the relative PPP theory, exchange rate changes over time are assumed to be dependent on inflation rate \\ndifferentials between countries according to the following formula:  \\n \\nHere the percentage change in the dollar value between the first period and the second period is given on \\nthe left side. The right side gives the differences in the inflation rates between Mexico and the United \\nStates that were evaluated over the same time period. The implication of relative PPP is that if the \\nMexican inflation rate exceeds the U.S. inflation rate, then the dollar will appreciate by that differential \\nover the same period. The logic of this theory is the same as in absolute PPP. Importers and exporters \\nrespond to variations in the relative costs of market baskets so as to maintain the law of one price, at le ast \\non average. If prices continue to rise faster in Mexico than in the United States, for example, price \\ndifferences between the two countries would grow and the only way to keep up with PPP is for the dollar \\nto appreciate continually versus the peso. \\nKEY  TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Purchasing power parity (PPP) will not be satisfied between countries when there are \\ntransportation costs, trade barriers (e.g., tariffs), differences in prices of nontradable inputs (e.g., \\nrental space), imperfect information about current market conditions, and when other Forex \\nmarket participants, such as investors, trade currencies for other reasons. \\n• Relative PPP is a dynamic version of the theory that relates currency appreciation or \\ndepreciation to differences in country inflation rates. \\nEX ERCISE  \\n1.

Interpret the PPP theory as a projection of long-term tendencies in exchange rate values. \\nIn general, the purchasing power parity (PPP) theory works miserably when applied to real -world data. In \\nother words, it is rare for the PPP relationship to hold true between any two countries at any particular \\npoint in time. In most scientific disciplines, the failure of a theory to be supported by the data means the \\ntheory is refuted and should be thrown out or tossed away. However, economists have been reluctant to \\ndo that with the PPP theory. In part this is because the logic of the theory seems particularly sound. In \\npart it’s because there are so many “frictions” in the real world, such as tariffs, nontariff barriers, \\ntransportation costs, measurement problems, and so on that it would actually be surprising for the theory \\nto work when applied directly to the data. (It is much like expecting an object to follow Newton’s laws of \\nmotion while sitting on the ground.) \\nIn addition, economists have conceived of an alternative way to interpret or apply the PPP theory to \\novercome the empirical testing problem. The trick is to think of PPP as a “long-run” theory of exchange \\nrate determination rather than a short-run theory. Under such an interpretation, it is no longer necessary \\nfor PPP to hold at any point in time. Instead, the PPP exchange rate is thought to represent a target \\ntoward which the spot exchange rate is slowly drawn. \\nThis long-run interpretation requires an assumption that importers and exporters cannot respond q uickly \\nto deviations in the cost of market baskets between countries. Instead of immediate responses to price \\ndifferences between countries by engaging in arbitrage— buying at the low price and selling high— traders \\nrespond slowly to these price signals. Some reasons for the delay include imperfect information (traders \\nare not aware of the price differences), long-term contracts (traders must wait till current contractual \\narrangements expire), and/or marketing costs (entry to new markets requires research and  setup costs). \\nIn addition, we recognize that the exchange rate is not solely determined by trader behavior. Investors, \\nwho respond to different incentives, might cause persistent deviations from the PPP exchange rate even if \\ntraders continue to respond to the price differences. \\nWhen there is a delayed response, PPP no longer needs to hold at a particular point in time. However, the \\ntheory does imagine that traders eventually will adjust to the price differences (buying low and selling \\nhigh), causing an eventual adjustment of the spot exchange rate toward the PPP rate.

In this case, \\nthe spot exchange rate is adjusting toward a moving target. \\nHow long will this adjustment take? In other words, how long is the long run? The term itself is generally \\nused by economists to represent some “unspecified” long period of time; it might be several months, \\nyears, or even decades. Also, since the target, the PPP exchange rate, is constantly changing, it is quite \\npossible that it is never reached. The adjustment process may never allow the exchange rate to catch up to \\nthe target even though it is constantly chasing it. \\nPerhaps the best way to see what the long-run PPP theory suggests is to considerFigure 6.3 \"Hypothetical \\nLong-Term Trend\". The figure presents constructed data (i.e., made up) between two countries, A and B. \\nThe dotted black line shows the ratio of the costs of market baskets between the two countries over a long \\nperiod, a century between 1904 and 2004. It displays a steady increase, indicating that prices have risen \\nfaster in country A relative to country B. The solid blue line shows a plot of the exchange rate between the \\ntwo countries during the same period. If PPP were to hold at every point in time, then the exchange rate \\nplot would lie directly on top of the market basket ratio plot. The fact that it does not means PPP did not \\nhold all the time. In fact, PPP held only at times when the exchange rate plo t crosses the market basket \\nratio plot; on the diagram this happened only twice during the century — not a very good record. \\nNonetheless, despite performing poorly with respect to moment-by-moment PPP, the figure displays an \\nobvious regularity. The trend of the exchange rate between the countries is almost precisely the trend in \\nthe market basket ratio; both move upward at about the same “average” rate. Sometimes the exchange \\nrate is below the market basket ratio, even for a long period of time, but at other times, the exchange rate \\nrises up above the market basket ratio. \\nThe \\nide\\na \\nher\\ne is \\nthat \\nlen\\ngth\\nFigure 6.4 U.S./UK Long-Term Trends \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Eventually, traders will respond \\nto these price discrepancies and begin to import more from the less expensive country. This will lead to \\nthe increase in demand for that country’s currency and cause the exchange rate to move back toward the \\nmarket basket ratio. However, in the long-run version of the theory, this will take time, sometimes a \\nconsiderable amount of time, even years or more. \\nTo see how this relationship works in one real-world example, consider Figure 6.4 \"U.S./UK Long-Term \\nTrends\". It plots the exchange rate (E$/£) between the U.S. dollar and the British pound between 1913 and \\n2004 together with an adjusted ratio of the countries’ consumer price indices (CPIs) during the same \\nperiod.

Note how closely the exchange rate tracks the trend in the market \\nbasket ratio. This remains true even though the exchange rate remained fixed during some lengthy \\nperiods of time, as in the 1950s and 1960s. While this depiction is just two countries  over a long period, it \\nis suggestive that the long-run version of PPP may have some validity. \\nMore sophisticated empirical tests of the long-run version of PPP have shown mixed results, as some \\nstudies support the hypothesis while others tend to reject it. Regardless, there is much more support for \\nthis version of the theory than for the much more simplistic short-run version. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Under the long-run purchasing power parity (PPP) theory, the PPP exchange rate is thought to \\nrepresent a target toward which the spot exchange rate is slowly drawn over time.

Recognize how the terms overvalued and undervalued exchange rates are defined, applied, and \\ninterpreted. \\nIt is quite common to hear people claim that a country’s exchange rate is overvalued or undervalued. The \\nfirst question one should ask when someone claims the exchange rate is overvalued is “overvalued with \\nrespect to what?” There are two common reference exchange rates often considered. The person may \\nmean the exchange rate is overvalued with respect to purchasing power parity (PPP), or he may mean the \\nexchange rate is overvalued relative to the rate presumed Needed to balance the current account (CA).  \\nThe mere use of these terms suggests immediately that there is some “proper” value for the exchange rate. \\nHowever, one should refrain from accepting this implication. As was previously discussed, PPP is unlikely \\nto hold, even over very long periods, for a variety of very good reasons. Also, there is no reason to think \\nthat current account balance represents some equilibrium or goal for an economy: countries  can run trade \\ndeficits or surpluses for an extended period and suffer no ill effects. Thus overvaluation or undervaluation \\nof an exchange rate, for either reason (PPP or current account balance) should be thought of simply as \\nsomething that happens. Of more interest is what it means when it happens. \\nOver- and Undervaluation with Respect to PPP \\nFirst let’s consider over- and undervaluation with respect to PPP. The PPP exchange rate is defined as the \\nrate that equalizes the cost of a market basket of goods between two countries. The PPP exchange rate \\nbetween the Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar would be written as  \\n \\nwhich represents the PPP value of the U.S. dollar in terms of pesos. \\nIf the U.S. dollar is overvalued with respect to the Mexican peso, then the spot exchange rate exceeds the \\nPPP exchange rate: \\n \\nThis will also mean the exchange rate exceeds the ratio of market basket costs:  \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The right side (RS) is the cost of the basket in Mexico also evaluated in pesos. \\nSince LS > RS, goods and services cost more on average in the United States than in Mexico at the current \\nexchange rate. Thus for the U.S. dollar to be overvalued with respect to the peso means that goods and \\nservices are relatively more expensive in the United States than in Mexico. Of course, it also implies that \\ngoods and services are relatively cheaper in Mexico. \\nA simple guide to judge whether a currency is overvalued is to consider it from the perspective of a tourist. \\nWhen the U.S. dollar is overvalued, a U.S. tourist traveling to Mexico will find that many products seem \\ncheaper than in the United States, after converting at the spot exchange rate. Thus an overvalued currency \\nwill buy more in other countries. \\nAn undervalued currency works in the opposite direction. When the U.S. dollar is undervalued, the cost of \\na basket of goods in the United States is lower than the cost in Mexico when evaluated at the current \\nexchange rate. To a U.S. tourist, Mexican goods and services would seem more expensive on average. \\nThus an undervalued currency will buy less in other countries. \\nFinally, if the U.S. dollar is overvalued with respect to the Mexican peso, it follows that the peso is \\nundervalued with respect to the dollar. In this case, since the U.S. tourists would find Mexican goods \\ncomparatively cheap, Mexican tourists would find U.S. goods to be comparatively expensive. If the U.S. \\ndollar were undervalued, then the peso would be overvalued.  \\nIs overvaluation or undervaluation good or bad? That depends on what a person is trying to achieve. For \\nexample, if the U.S. dollar is overvalued with respect to the peso, then a U.S. tourist  traveling to Mexico \\nwill be very happy. In fact, the more overvalued the dollar is, the better. However, for an exporter of U.S. \\ngoods to Mexico, its price in peso terms will be higher the more overvalued is the dollar.

A change in the exchange rate offers one viable \\nmethod to affect trade flows. \\nSuppose the United States has a trade deficit (which it indeed has had for more than thirty years prio r to \\n2010). If the U.S. dollar value were to fall— a dollar depreciation— then foreign goods would all become \\nrelatively more expensive to U.S. residents, tending to reduce U.S. imports. At the same time, a dollar \\ndepreciation would also cause U.S. goods to become relatively cheaper to foreign residents tending to \\nraise U.S. exports. \\nSometimes economists make numerical estimations as to how much the dollar value would have to fall to \\nbring trade into balance. These estimations are enormously difficult to make  for several reasons and \\nshould be interpreted and used with great caution, if at all. The primary reason is that many different \\nfactors on both the trade side and the financial side influence a country’s trade imbalance besides just the \\nexchange rate. The exchange rate that balances trade would depend on the values taken by all the other \\nfactors that also influence the trade balance. Different values for all the other variables would mean a \\ndifferent exchange rate needed to balance trade. Thus there isn’t one exchange rate value that will balance \\ntrade. Instead, there is a different exchange rate value that will balance trade in each and every alternative \\ncircumstance. Indeed, even the current exchange rate— whatever that is— can balance trade if other factors \\nchange appropriately. \\nDespite these cautions, many observers will still contend that a country’s currency needs to depreciate by \\nsome percentage to eliminate a trade deficit, or needs to appreciate to eliminate a trade surplus. When it \\nis believed a depreciation of the currency is needed to balance trade, they will say the currency is \\novervalued. When it is believed an appreciation of the currency is needed to balance trade, they will say \\nthe currency is undervalued. However, in a floating exchange rate system, it is hard to argue that the \\nexchange rate is at the “wrong” value since— with competition in the market— it will always be at the rate \\nthat equalizes supply and demand. In other words, the “proper” value for the exchange rate can be said to \\nbe not the one that will satisfy PPP or not the one that will generate trade balance but rather whatever rate \\ncurrently prevails. Under this notion, a currency can never be over- or undervalued in a floating exchange \\nrate system. Instead, the spot exchange rate is always at the “proper” value.

Learn why using PPP exchange rates to convert income data to a common currency is a better \\nmethod for making cross-country comparisons. \\nProbably the most important application of purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates is in making \\ncross-country comparisons of income, wages, or gross domestic product (GDP). Suppose that we would \\nlike to compare per capita GDP between two countries— say, the United States and China. In 2004, GDP \\nin the United States was approximately $12 trillion; in China GDP was about ¥16 trillion. With a \\npopulation in the United States of 290 million people, per capita U.S. GDP works out to $41,400 per \\nperson. China’s population was approximately 1.3 billion people in 2004, so its GDP per capita works out \\nto 11,500 yuan (¥) per person. However, we can’t compare these two per capita figures since they are in \\ndifferent units— dollars and yuan. Thus we need to convert units, either turn dollars into yuan or yuan into \\ndollars. \\nThe simplest approach to make this conversion is to use the spot exchange rate that prevai led in 2004, \\nwhich was 8.28 yuan per dollar. Converting yuan to dollars yields a per capita GDP for China of $1,390. \\nNote that at $41,400 per person, U.S. per capita GDP was almost thirty times higher than China’s. \\nHowever, there is a problem using this method. One thing that is quickly recognized by Americans when \\nthey travel in and around China is that many goods and services seem considerably cheaper than they are \\nin the United States. From a Chinese traveler’s perspective, many U.S. goods would seem considerably \\nmore expensive. The implication is that although U.S. GDP per person is thirty times higher, that income \\nmay not purchase thirty times more goods and services in the U.S. because the prices of U.S. goods and \\nservices are so much higher when converted at the current exchange rate. Since presumably we are \\ncomparing per capita GDPs to compare how “well-off” people are in one country relative to another, these \\nper capita figures will not accurately reflect these differences. \\nA solution is found in the purchasing power parity theory (PPP). When prices for similar goods differ as \\ndescribed in the previous paragraph, we would say the U.S. dollar is overvalued with respect to the yuan \\nand with respect to PPP. At the same time, we would say the yuan is unde rvalued vis-à-vis the dollar.

The PPP exchange rate is that exchange rate that would equalize the \\nvalue of comparable market baskets of goods and services between two countries.  \\nFor example, the estimated PPP exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and yuan in 2004 was 1.85 ¥/$. If \\nthis exchange rate had prevailed between the countries, the prices of U.S. goods wou ld seem, on average, \\nto be approximately equal to the prices that prevailed in China. Now, if we use this exchange rate to make \\nthe conversion to dollars of GDP per capita in China, then we will get a number that reflects the \\npurchasing power of Chinese income in terms of the prices that prevail in the United States — that is, in \\nterms of prices that are equalized between the countries. \\nThus if we take China’s GDP per capita of ¥11,500 and convert to dollars with the PPP exchange rate, we \\nget $6,250 per person. The units derived in this expression would typically be called “international \\ndollars.” What this means is that ¥11,500 will buy a bundle of goods and services in China that would cost \\n$6,250 if purchased in the United States at U.S. prices. In other words, ¥11,500 is equal to $6,250 when \\nthe prices of goods and services are equalized between countries.  \\nThe PPP method of conversion is a much more accurate way of making cross -country comparisons of \\nvalues between countries. In this example, although China’s per capita GDP was still considerably lower \\nthan in the United States ($6,250 vs. $41,400), it is nonetheless four and a half times higher than using \\nthe spot exchange rate ($6,250 vs. $1,390). The higher value takes account of the differences in prices  \\nbetween the countries and thus better reflects the differences in purchasing power of per capita GDP.  \\nThe PPP conversion method has become the standard method used by the World Bank and others in \\nmaking cross-country comparisons of GDP, GDP per capita, and average incomes and wages. For most \\ncomparisons concerning the size of economies or standards of living, using PPP is a more accurate \\nmethod and can fundamentally change our perception of how countries compare. To see how, \\nconsider Table 6.1 \"GDP Rankings (in Billions of Dollars), 2008\", constructed from World Bank data.

Learn how a money market model, combining money supply and demand, influences the \\nequilibrium interest rate in an economy. \\nThis chapter describes how the supply of money and the demand for money combine to affect the \\nequilibrium interest rate in an economy. The model is called the money  market model. \\nA country’s money supply is mostly the amount of coin and currency in circulation and the total value of \\nall checking accounts in banks. These two types of assets are the most liquid (i.e., most easily used to buy \\ngoods and services). The amount of money available to spend in an economy is mostly determined by the \\ncountry’s central bank. The bank can control the total amount of money in circulation by using several \\nlevers (or tools), the most important of which is the sale or purchase of U.S. government Treasury bonds. \\nCentral bank sales or purchases of Treasury bonds are called “open market operations.” \\nMoney demand refers to the demand by households, businesses, and the government, for highly liquid \\nassets such as currency and checking account deposits. Money demand is affected by the  desire to buy \\nthings soon, but it is also affected by the opportunity cost of holding money. The opportunity cost is the \\ninterest earnings one gives up on other assets to hold money. \\nIf interest rates rise, households and businesses will likely allocate more of their asset holdings into \\ninterest-bearing accounts (these are usually not classified as money) and will hold less in the form of \\nmoney. Since interest-bearing deposits are the primary source of funds used to lend in the financial \\nsector, changes in total money demand affect the supply of loanable funds and in turn affect the interest \\nrates on loans. \\nMoney supply and money demand will equalize only at one average interest rate. Also, at this interest \\nrate, the supply of loanable funds financial institutions wish to lend equalizes the amount that borrowers \\nwish to borrow. Thus the equilibrium interest rate in the economy is the rate that equalizes money supply \\nand money demand. \\nUsing the money market model, several important relationships between key economic variables are \\nshown: \\n• When the money supply rises (falls), the equilibrium interest rate falls (rises).  \\n• When the price level increases (decreases), the equilibrium interest rate rises (falls).

Recognize how casual uses of the term money differ from the more formal definition used in the \\nmoney market model. \\n2. Learn how to interpret the equilibrium interest rate in a world in which there are many different \\ninterest rates applied and different types of loans and deposits. \\nThere are several sources of confusion that can affect complete understanding of this basic model.  \\nThe first source of confusion concerns the use of the term “money.” In casual conversation, money is \\nsometimes used more narrowly and sometimes more broadly than the formal definition. For example, \\nsomeone might say, “I want to be a doctor so I will make a lot of money.” In this case, the person is really \\nreferring to income, not money, per se. Since income is typically paid using money, the everyday \\nsubstitution of the term money for income does make sense, but it can lead to confusion in interpreting \\nthe forthcoming model. In general, people use the term money whenever they want to refer to a country’s \\ncoin and currency and anything these items are used for in payment. However, our formal definition \\nof money also includes items that are not coin and currency. Checking accoun t deposits are an example of \\na type of money included in the formal definition but not more casually thought of as money. Thus pay \\nattention to the definition and description below and be sure to recognize that one’s common conception \\nof money may or may not overlap precisely with the formal definition. \\nA second source of confusion involves our usage of the term interest rate. The model that will be \\ndeveloped will derive an equilibrium interest rate for the economy. However, everyone knows that there \\nare many interest rates in the economy, and each of these rates is different. There are different rates for \\nyour checking and savings account, different rates on a car loan and mortgage, different rates on credit \\ncards and government bonds. Thus it is typical to wonder what interest rate we are talking about when we \\ndescribe the equilibrium interest rate. \\nIt is important to note that financial institutions make money (here I really should say “make a profit”) by \\nlending to one group at a higher rate than it borrows. In other words, financial institutions accept deposits \\nfrom one group of people (savers) and lend it to another group of people (borrowers.) If they charge a \\nhigher interest rate on their loans than they do on deposits, the bank will make a profit.

When we talk about the equilibrium interest rate in the forthcoming model, it will \\nmostly apply to the interest rates on deposits rather than loans. However, we also have a small problem in \\ninterpretation since different deposits have different interest rates. Thus which interest rate are we really \\ntalking about? \\nThe best way to interpret the equilibrium interest rate in the model is as a kind of average interest rate on \\ndeposits. At the end of this chapter, we will discuss economic changes that lead to an increase or decrease \\nin the equilibrium interest rate. We should take these changes to mean several things. First, that average \\ninterest rates on deposits will rise. Now, some of these rates may rise and a few may fall, but there will be \\npressure for the average to increase. Second, since banks may be expected to maintain their rate of profit \\n(if possible) when average deposit interest rates do increase, average interest rates on loans will also \\nincrease. Again, some loan rates may rise and some fall, but the market pressure will tend to push them \\nupward. \\nThe implication is that when the equilibrium interest rate changes we should e xpect most interest rates to \\nmove in the same direction. Thus the equilibrium interest rate really is referring to an average interest \\nrate across the entire economy, for deposits and for loans. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The term money is used causally in a different ways than we define it in the model: \\nhere money is defined as total value of coin and currency in circulation and checking account \\ndeposits at a point in time. \\n• The equilibrium interest rate in the money market model should be interpreted as an average \\ninterest rate across the entire economy, for deposits and for loans. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Learn why money exists and what purpose it serves. \\nThe money supply in a country refers to a stock of assets that can be readily used to purchase goods and \\nservices. An asset is anything that has value. Anything that has value could potentially be used in \\nexchange for other goods, services, or assets. However, some assets are more easily exchangeable than \\nother assets. \\nExamples of assets include currency, checking account balances, stocks, bonds, whole life insurance \\npolicies, real estate, and automobiles. Currency— dollar bills in the United States, pounds sterling in \\nBritain, and pesos in Mexico— is an asset that is readily exchangeable for goods and services within its \\nrespective countries. In contrast, real estate is an asset that is very difficult to use to buy goods. For \\nexample, no grocery store would accept ownership of a few square feet of your house in exchange for your \\nweekly groceries. The idea of this transaction is unimaginable. Yet these two extreme cases can help us \\nunderstand the distinction we make between assets classified as money and those not considered money. \\nMost textbook definitions ofmoney begin by defining several of money’s key features. \\nMoney as a Unit of Account \\nOne of the most important features of money is its application as a unit of account. In other words, we \\nchoose to measure the value of goods, services, and assets in terms of currency or money. In ancient \\nsocieties, shells, shovels, hoes, knives, cattle, and grain were used as money. In these cases, it would have \\nbeen common to define the value of an item in terms of how many shells, or knives, or cows, and so on the \\nitem exchanges for. The standard unit of account in a country is its currenc y: dollars in the United States, \\nyen in Japan, and euros in the European Union. \\nMoney as a Medium of Exchange \\nThe key distinguishing feature of money, as compared with other nonmoney assets, is its role as a medium \\nof exchange. Coin, and later currency, came into existence primarily to serve as a vehicle for the exchange \\nof goods and services. Rather than hauling around items that you might hope to barter exchange for other \\ngoods you need, it is easier and more efficient to carry coin and currency to purcha se goods. However, in \\norder for money to function in this role, it must have widespread acceptability.

Their willingness to accept will in turn \\ndepend on the expectation that they’ll be able to use that coin later to buy the goods they want. \\nOther types of assets are often not acceptable as a medium of exchange. For example, if I own a $1,000 \\nU.S. savings bond, I am unlikely to be able to use the bond to purchase item s in a store. Bonds can be \\ntraded at a bank or a bond market, where exchanges of this sort are common, but not anywhere else. Thus \\nbonds do not function as a medium of exchange. \\nLiquidity is a term used to describe the distinction made here between bonds a nd currency. An asset is \\nsaid to be liquid if it is readily exchangeable for goods and services. An asset is illiquid if it is not easily \\nexchangeable. Thus coin and currency are very liquid assets, while bonds are more illiquid. Real estate is \\nan example of a very illiquid asset since it could take a considerable amount of time to convert the \\nownership share of a home into a spendable form. \\nMoney as a Store of Value \\nPerhaps the least important characteristic of money is an ability to serve as a store of value. This is less \\nimportant because it does not distinguish money from other assets. All assets serve as a store of value. As \\nan example, if I want to save some income from each paycheck so that I can go on a vacation next year, I \\nneed to hold that income in a form that will maintain its purchasing power. One simple way to hold it is by \\ncashing my paycheck and putting currency into an envelope. That money accumulating in the envelope \\nwill be easily used to purchase plane tickets and a hotel room when I take my vacation next year. In this \\nway, holding currency will allow me to store value over time. On the other hand, I could cash each \\npaycheck and deposit some of the money I want to save into my online stock trading account. With these \\nfunds I can purchase stocks, another form of asset. Next year, I can sell the stocks and use the money to \\ntake my vacation. Thus stocks represent a store of value as well. \\nKEY TAKEAWAY  \\n• Money is any asset that serves as a unit of account and can be used as a medium of exchange for \\neconomic transactions. It is all assets that have a high degree of liquidity. Money also serves as a \\nstore of value, but it is not unique in this role. \\nEXERCISE  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn the various definitions of money supply and their approximate values in the U.S. economy. \\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank (or “Federal Reserve,” and more informally, “the Fed”) \\nreports several distinct measures of the aggregate money supply. The narrowest measure, M1, includes \\nonly the most liquid assets. Higher numbers following an “M” reflect broader measures of money that \\ninclude less liquid assets. Below is a description of M1–M3. However, unless otherwise specified, all later \\nreferences to the money supply will relate to the M1 definition. \\nMoney Supply Measure “M1” \\nM1 consists of the most highly liquid assets. That is, M1 includes all forms of assets that are easily \\nexchangeable as payment for goods and services. It consists of coin and currency in circulation, traveler’s \\nchecks, demand deposits, and other checkable deposits. \\nThe first item in M1 is currency and coin in circulation. In the United States, “currency” refers to $1, $5, \\n$10, $20, $50, and $100 bills. U.S. “coin,” meanwhile, refers to pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters. “In \\ncirculation” means that it has to be outside of banks, in people’s wallets or purses and businesses’ cash \\nregisters. Once the currency or coin is deposited in a bank, it is no longer considered to be in circulation, \\nthus it is no longer a part of the M1 money supply. \\nThe second item of M1 is traveler’s checks. Traveler’s checks are like currency, except that they have a \\nform of insurance tied to them. If a traveler’s check is lost or stolen, the issuer will reimburse you for the \\nloss. \\nThe third item in M1 is demand deposits or checking account balances in banks. These consist of money \\nindividuals and businesses have deposited into an account in which a check can be written to pay for \\ngoods and services. When a check is presented to the bank, it represents a demand for transfer of funds \\nfrom the check writer to the agent receiving the check. Since the funds must be disbursed on demand, we \\nalso refer to these as demand deposits. \\nThe final category in M1 is labeled “other checkable deposits.” This consists of two items; NOW accounts \\nand ATS accounts. NOW stands for “negotiable orders of withdrawal.” A NOW account is exactly like a \\nchecking account except for one thing: it can earn interest. Thus checking accounts without interest are \\ndemand deposits and those with interest are NOW accounts. ATS stands for “automatic transfer service.” ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Demand deposits \\nand other checkable deposits almost equally split the remaining shares of M1 at close to 25 percent each. \\nThe total value of the M1 money supply is $1,688 billion, which is over 10 percent of annual U.S. GDP.  \\nTable 7.1 Components of U.S. M1 Money Supply, November 2009 \\n \\nBillions ($) Total M1 (%) \\nCurrency in Circulation 859.1 51 \\nTraveler’s Checks 5.1 < 1 \\nDemand Deposits 439.0 26 \\nOther Checkable Deposits 385.4 23 \\nTotal M1 Money Supply 1,688.7 100 \\nSource: Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Money Stock Measures, January 14, \\n2010.http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/Current. \\nMoney Supply Measure “M2” \\nM2 is a broader measure of money than M1. It includes all of M1, the most liquid assets, and a collecti on \\nof additional assets that are slightly less liquid. These additional assets include savings accounts, money \\nmarket deposit accounts, small time deposits (less than $100,000) and retail money market mutual \\nfunds. Excluded are IRA and Keogh deposits in money market accounts.

Learn the mechanisms (or tools) the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank can use to control the U.S. money \\nsupply. \\nThe size of the money stock in a country is primarily controlled by its central bank. In the United States, \\nthe central bank is the Federal Reserve Bank while the main group affecting the money supply is the \\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC). This committee meets approximately every six weeks and is \\nthe body that determines monetary policy. There are twelve voting members, including the seven \\nmembers of the Fed Board of Governors and five presidents drawn from the twelve Federal Reserve banks \\non a rotating basis. The current Chairman of the Board of Governors is Ben Bernanke (as of January \\n2010). Because Bernanke heads the group that controls the money supply of the largest economy in the \\nworld, and because the FOMC’s actions can have immediate and dramatic effects on interest rates and \\nhence the overall United States and international economic condition, he is perhaps the most \\neconomically influential person in the world today. As you’ll read later, because of his importance, \\nanything he says in public can have tremendous repercussions throughou t the international marketplace. \\nThe Fed has three main levers that can be applied to affect the money supply within the economy: (1) \\nopen market operations, (2) reserve requirement changes, and (3) changes in the discount rate. \\nThe Fed’s First Lever: Open Market Operations \\nThe most common lever used by the Fed is open market operations. This refers to Fed purchases or sales \\nof U.S. government Treasury bonds or bills. The “open market” refers to the secondary market for these \\ntypes of bonds. (The market is called secondary because the government originally issued the bonds at \\nsome time in the past.) \\nWhen the Fed purchases bonds on the open market it will result in an increase in the money supply. If it \\nsells bonds on the open market, it will result in a decrease in the money supply. \\nHere’s why. A purchase of bonds means the Fed buys a U.S. government Treasury bond from one of its \\nprimary dealers. This includes one of twenty-three financial institutions authorized to conduct trades with \\nthe Fed. These dealers regularly trade government bonds on the secondary market and treat the Fed as \\none of their regular customers. It is worth highlighting that bonds sold on the secondary open market are \\nbonds issued by the government months or years before and will not matur e for several months or years ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Thus when the Fed purchases a bond from a primary dealer in the future, when that bond \\nmatures, the government would have to pay back the Fed, which is the new owner of that bond.  \\nWhen the open market operation (OMO) purchase is made, the Fed will credit that dealer’s reserve \\ndeposits with the sale price of the bond (e.g., $1 million). The Fed will receive the IOU, or “I owe you” (i.e., \\nbond certificate), in exchange. The money used by the Fed to purchase this bo nd does not need to come \\nfrom somewhere. The Fed doesn’t need gold, other deposits, or anything else to cover this payment. \\nInstead, the payment is created out of thin air. An accounting notation is made to indicate that the bank \\nselling the bond now has an extra $1 million in its reserve account. \\nAt this point, there is still no change in the money supply. However, because of the increase in its reserves, \\nthe dealer now has additional money to lend out somewhere else, perhaps to earn a greater rate of retu rn. \\nWhen the dealer does lend it, it will create a demand deposit account for the borrower and since a demand \\ndeposit is a part of the M1 money supply, money has now been created.  \\nAs shown in all introductory macroeconomics textbooks, the initial loan, onc e spent by the borrower, is \\nultimately deposited in checking accounts in other banks. These increases in deposits can in turn lead to \\nfurther loans, subject to maintenance of the bank’s deposit reserve requirements. Each new loan made \\ncreates additional demand deposits and hence leads to further increases in the M1 money supply. This is \\ncalled the money multiplier process. Through this process, each $1 million bond purchase by the Fed can \\nlead to an increase in the overall money supply many times that level. \\nThe opposite effect will occur if the Fed sells a bond in an OMO. In this case, the Fed receives payment \\nfrom a dealer (as in our previous example) in exchange for a previously issued government bond. (It is \\nimportant to remember that the Fed does not issue government bonds; government bonds are issued by \\nthe U.S. Treasury department. If the Fed were holding a mature government bond, the Treasury would be \\nobligated to pay off the face value to the Fed, just as if it were a private business or bank.) The p ayment \\nmade by the dealer comes from its reserve assets. These reserves support the dealer’s abilities to make \\nloans and in turn to stimulate the money creation process. Now that its reserves are reduced, the dealer’s \\nability to create demand deposits via loans is reduced and hence the money supply is also reduced \\naccordingly. \\nA more detailed description of open market operations can be found at New York Federal Reserve Bank’s \\nWeb site athttp://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed32.html.

When the Fed \\nraises the reserve requirement on deposits, the money supply decreases.  \\nThe reserve requirement is a rule set by the Fed that must be satisfied by all depository institutions, \\nincluding commercial banks, savings banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions. The rule requires that a \\nfraction of the bank’s total transactions deposits (e.g., this would include checking accounts but not \\ncertificates of deposit) be held as a reserve either in the form of coin and currency in its vau lt or as a \\ndeposit (reserve) held at the Fed. The current reserve requirement in the United States (as of December \\n2009) is 10 percent for deposits over $55.2 million. (For smaller banks — that is, those with lower total \\ndeposits— the reserve requirement is lower.) \\nAs discussed above, the reserve requirement affects the ability of the banking system to create additional \\ndemand deposits through the money creation process. For example, with a reserve requirement of 10 \\npercent, Bank A, which receives a deposit of $100, will be allowed to lend out $90 of that deposit, holding \\nback $10 as a reserve. The $90 loan will result in the creation of a $90 demand deposit in the name of the \\nborrower, and since this is a part of the money supply M1, it rises accordingly. When  the borrower spends \\nthe $90, a check will be drawn on Bank A’s deposits and this $90 will be transferred to another checking \\naccount, say, in Bank B. Since Bank B’s deposits have now risen by $90, it will be allowed to lend out $81 \\ntomorrow, holding back $9 (10 percent) as a reserve. This $81 will make its way to another bank, leading \\nto another increase in deposits, allowing another increase in loans, and so on. The total amount of \\ndemand deposits (DD) created through this process is given by the formula \\n \\nDD = $100 + (.9)$100 + (.9)(.9)$100 + (.9)(.9)(.9)$100 +…. \\nThis simplifies to \\nDD = $100/(1 − 0.9) = $1,000 \\nor \\nDD = $100/RR, \\nwhere RR refers to the reserve requirement.

However, if the reserve \\nrequirement were 5 percent, a $100 T-bill purchase would lead to a $2,000 increase in the money supply.  \\nHowever, the reserve requirement not only affects the Fed’s ability to create new money but also allows \\nthe banking system to create more demand deposits (hence more money) out of the total deposits it now \\nhas. Thus if the Fed were to lower the reserve requirement to 5 percent, the b anking system would be able \\nto increase the volume of its loans considerably and it would lead to a substantial increase in the money \\nsupply. \\nBecause small changes in the reserve requirement can have substantial effects on the money supply, the \\nFed does not use reserve requirement changes as a primary lever to adjust the money supply.  \\nA more detailed description of open market operations can be found at New York Federal Reserve Bank \\nWeb site athttp://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed45.html. \\nThe Fed’s Third Lever: Discount Rate/Federal Funds Rate Changes \\nWhen the Fed lowers its target federal funds rate and discount rate, it signals an expanded money supply \\nand lower overall interest rates. \\nWhen the Fed raises its target federal funds rate and discount rate, it signals a reduced money supply and \\nhigher overall interest rates. \\nIn news stories immediately after the FOMC meets, one is likely to read that the Fed raised (or lo wered) \\ninterest rates yesterday.

The rate that is \\nannounced every month is not the discount rate, but the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the \\ninterest rate banks charge each other for short-term (usually overnight) loans. The Fed does not actually \\nset the federal funds rate, but it does employ open market operations to tar get this rate at a desired level. \\nThus what is announced at the end of each FOMC meeting is the target federal funds rate.  \\nThe main reason banks make overnight loans to each other each day is to maintain their reserve \\nrequirements. Each day some banks may end up with excess reserves. Other banks may find themselves \\nshort of reserves. Those banks with excess reserves would prefer to loan out as much as possible at some \\nrate of interest rather than earning nothing.

The discount window refers to a policy by the Fed to lend money on a short -term basis (usually \\novernight) to financial institutions. The interest rate charged on these loans is called the discount rate. \\nBefore 2003, banks needed to demonstrate that they had exhausted all other options before coming to  the \\ndiscount window. After 2003, the Fed revised its policies and set a primary credit discount rate and a \\nsecondary credit discount rate. Primary credit rates are set 100 basis points (1 percent) above the federal \\nfunds rate and are available only to very sound, financially strong banks. Secondary credit rates are set \\n150 basis points above the federal funds target rate and are available to banks not eligible for primary \\ncredit. Although these loans are typically made overnight, they can be extended for l onger periods and can \\nbe used for any purpose. \\nBefore the changes in discount window policy in 2003, very few banks sought loans through the discount \\nwindow. Hence, it was not a very effective lever in monetary policy.  \\nHowever, the announcement of the federal funds target rate after each FOMC meeting does remain an \\nimportant signal about the future course of Fed monetary policy. If the FOMC announces a lower target \\nfederal funds rate, one should expect expanded money supply, perhaps achieved through open ma rket \\noperations. If the FOMC announces a higher target rate, one should prepare for a \\nmore contractionary monetary policy to follow. \\nA more detailed description of the discount window can be found on the New York Federal Reserve Bank \\nWeb site athttp://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed18.html.

Learn the determinants of money demand in an economy. \\nThe demand for money represents the desire of households and businesses to hold assets in a form that \\ncan be easily exchanged for goods and services. Spendability (or liquidity) is the key aspect of money that \\ndistinguishes it from other types of assets. For this reason, the demand for money is sometimes called the \\ndemand for liquidity. \\nThe demand for money is often broken into two distinct categories: the transactions demand and the \\nspeculative demand. \\nTransactions Demand for Money \\nThe primary reason people hold money is because they expect to use it to buy something sometime soon. \\nIn other words, people expect to make transactions for goods or services. How much money a person \\nholds onto should probably depend on the value of the transactions that are anticipated. Thus a person on \\nvacation might demand more money than on a typical day. Wealthier people might also demand more \\nmoney because their average daily expenditures are higher than the average person’s. \\nHowever, in this section we are interested not so much in an individual’s demand for money but rather in \\nwhat determines the aggregate, economy-wide demand for money. Extrapolating from the individual to \\nthe group, we could conclude that the total value of all transactions in the economy during a period would \\ninfluence the aggregate transactions demand for money. Gross domestic product (GD P), the value of all \\ngoods and services produced during the year, will influence the aggregate value of all transactions since all \\nGDP produced will be purchased by someone during the year.

To convert nominal to real GDP, \\nsimply divide nominal GDP by the current U.S. price level (P$); thus \\n \\nreal GDP = nominal GDP/P$. \\nIf we use the variable Y$ to represent real U.S. GDP and rearrange the equation, we can get \\n \\nnominal GDP = P$ Y$. \\nBy rewriting in this way we can now indicate that since the transactions demand for money rises with an \\nincrease in nominal GDP, it will also rise with either an increase in the general price level or an increase in \\nreal GDP. \\nThus if the amount of goods and services produced in the economy rises while the prices of all products \\nremain the same, then total GDP will rise and people will demand more money to make the additional \\ntransactions. On the other hand, if the average prices of goods and services produced in the economy rise, \\nthen even if the economy produces no additional products, people will still demand more money to \\npurchase the higher valued GDP, hence the demand for money to make transactions will rise.  \\nSpeculative Demand for Money \\nThe second type of money demand arises by considering the opportunity cost of holding money. Re call \\nthat holding money is just one of many ways to hold value or wealth. Alternative opportunities include \\nholding wealth in the form of savings deposits, certificate of deposits, mutual funds, stock, or even real \\nestate. For many of these alternative assets interest payments, or at least a positive rate of return, may be \\nobtained. Most assets considered money, such as coin and currency and most checking account deposits, \\ndo not pay any interest. If one does hold money in the form of a negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) \\naccount, a checking account with interest, the interest earned on that deposit will almost surely be less \\nthan on a savings deposit at the same institution. \\nThus to hold money implies giving up the opportunity of holding other assets that pay interest. The \\ninterest one gives up is the opportunity cost of holding money. \\nSince holding money is costly— that is, there is an opportunity cost— people’s demand for money should be \\naffected by changes in its cost. Since the interest rate on each person’s next best opportunity may differ \\nacross money holders, we can use the average interest rate (i$) in the economy as a proxy for the ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It is likely that as average interest rates rise, the opportunity cost of holding money for \\nall money holders will also rise, and vice versa. And as the cost of holding money rises, people should \\ndemand less money. \\nThe intuition is straightforward, especially if we exaggerate the story. Suppose interest rates on time \\ndeposits suddenly increased to 50 percent per year (from a very low base).

Define real money demand and supply functions, graph them relative to the interest rate, and \\nuse them to define the equilibrium interest rate in an economy. \\nDemand \\nA money demand function displays the influence that some aggregate economic variables will have on the \\naggregate demand for money. The above discussion indicates that money demand will depend positively \\non the level of real gross domestic product (GDP) and the price level due to the demand for transactions. \\nMoney demand will depend negatively on average interest rates due to specu lative concerns. We can \\ndepict these relationships by simply using the following functional representation:  \\n \\nHere MD is the aggregate, economy-wide money demand, P$ is the current U.S. price level, Y$ is the \\nUnited States’ real GDP, and i$ is the average U.S. interest rate. The f stands for “function.” The f is not a \\nvariable or parameter value; it simply means that some function exists that would map values for the \\nright-side variables, contained within the brackets, into the left-side variable. The “+” symbol above the \\nprice level and GDP levels means that there is a positive relationship between changes in that variable and \\nchanges in money demand. For example, an increase (decrease) in P$ would cause an increase (decrease) \\nin MD. A “−” symbol above the interest rate indicates that changes in i$ in one direction will cause money \\ndemand to change in the opposite direction. \\nFor historical reasons, the money demand function is often transformed into a real money demand \\nfunction as follows. First, rewrite the function on the right side to get \\n \\n In this version, the price level (P$) is brought outside the function f( ) and multiplied to a new function \\nlabeled L( ), called the “liquidity function.” Note that L( ) is different from f( ) since it contains \\nonly Y$ and i$ as variables. Since P$ is multiplied to L( ) it will maintain the positive relationship to MD and \\nthus is perfectly consistent with the previous specification.

We can also say that the liquidity function \\nrepresents the real demand for money in the economy— that is, the liquidity function is equivalent to real \\nmoney demand. \\nFinally, simply for intuition’s sake, any real variable represents the purchasing power of the variable in \\nterms of prices that prevailed in the base year of the price index. Thus real money demand can be thought \\nof as the purchasing power of money demanded in terms of base year prices.  \\nSupply \\nMoney supply is much easier to describe because we imagine that the level of money balances available in \\nan economy is simply set by the actions of the central bank. For this reason, it will not depend on other \\naggregate variables such as the interest rate, and thus we need no function to describe it.  \\nWe will use the parameter M$S to represent the nominal U.S. money supply and assume that the Federal \\nReserve Bank (or simply “the Fed”), using its three levers, can set this variable wherever it chooses.

Learn the equilibrium stories in the money market that describe how the interest rate adjusts \\nwhen it is not at its equilibrium value. \\nAny equilibrium in economics has an associated behavioral story to explain the forces that will move the \\nendogenous variable to the equilibrium value. In the money market model, the endogenous variable is the \\ninterest rate. This is the variable that will change to achieve the equilibrium. Variables that do not change \\nin the adjustment to the equilibrium are the exogenous variables. In this model, the e xogenous variables \\nare P$, Y$, and M$S. Changes in the exogenous variables are necessary to cause an adjustment to a new \\nequilibrium.

This means that people \\nand businesses wish to hold more \\nassets in a liquid, spendable form \\nrather than holding assets in a less \\nliquid form, such as in a savings \\naccount. This excess demand for \\nmoney will cause households and \\nbusinesses to convert assets from \\nless liquid accounts into checking \\naccounts or cash in their pockets. \\nA typical transaction would \\nFigure 7.2 Adjustment to Equilibrium: Interest Rate Too Low \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Millions of conversions such as this will be the \\nbehavioral response to an interest rate that is below equilibrium. As a result, the financial sector will \\nexperience a decrease in time deposit balances, which in turn will reduce their capacity to make loans. In \\nother words, withdrawals from savings and other type of nonmoney accounts will reduce the total pool of \\nfunds available to be loaned by the financial sector. With fewer funds to lend and the same demand for \\nloans, banks will respond by raising interest rates. Higher interest rates will reduce the demand for loans \\nhelping to equalize supply and demand for loans. Finally, as interest rates rise, money demand falls until \\nit equalizes with the actual money supply. Through this mechanism average interest rates will rise, \\nwhenever money demand exceeds money supply. \\nInterest Rate Too High \\nIf the actual interest rate is higher than the equilibrium rate, for some unspecified reason, then the \\nopposite adjustment will occur. In this case, real money supply will exceed real money demand, meaning \\nthat the amount of assets or wealth people and businesses are holding in  a liquid, spendable form is \\ngreater than the amount they would like to hold. The behavioral response would be to convert assets from \\nmoney into interest-bearing nonmoney deposits. A typical transaction would be if a person deposits some \\nof the cash in his wallet into his savings account. This transaction would reduce money holdings since \\ncurrency in circulation is reduced, but will increase the amount of funds available to loan out by the \\nbanks. The increase in loanable funds, in the face of constant demand for loans, will inspire banks to \\nlower interest rates to stimulate the demand for loans.

Learn how a change in the money supply affects the equilibrium interest rate. \\nExpansionary monetary policy refers to any policy initiative by a country’s central bank to raise (or \\nexpand) its money supply. This can be accomplished with open market purchases of government bonds, \\nwith a decrease in the reserve requirement, or with an announced decrease in the discount rate. In most \\ngrowing economies the money supply is expanded regularly to keep up with the expansion of gross \\ndomestic product (GDP). In this dynamic context, expansionary monetary policy can mean an increase in \\nthe rate of growth of the money supply, rather than a mere increase in money. However, the money \\nmarket model is a nondynamic (or static) model, so we cannot easily incorporate money supply growth \\nrates. Nonetheless, we can project the results from this static model to the dynamic world without much \\nloss of relevance. (In contrast, any decrease in the money supply or decrease in the growth rate of the \\nmoney supply is referred to as contractionary monetary policy.) \\nSuppose the money market is originally in equilibrium in Figure 7.3 \"Effects of a Money Supply \\nIncrease\" at point A with real money supply MS′/P$ and interest rate i$′ when the money supply increases, \\nceteris paribus. The ceteris paribus assumption means we assume that all other exogenous variables in the \\nmodel remain fixed at \\ntheir original levels.

Learn how a change in the price level affects the equilibrium interest rate. \\nNow let’s consider the effects of a price level increase in the money market. When the price level rises in \\nan economy, the average price of all goods and services sold is increasing. Inflation is calculated as the \\npercentage increase in a country’s price level over some period, usually a year. This means that in the \\nperiod during which the price level increases, inflation is occurring. Thus studying the effects of a price \\nlevel increase is the same as studying the effects of inflation. \\nInflation can arise for several reasons that will be discussed later in this chapter. For now, we will imagine \\nthat the price level increases for some unspecified reason and consider the consequences.  \\nSuppose the money market is originally in equilibrium at point A in Figure 7.4 \"Effects of a Price Level \\nIncrease\" with real money supply MS/P$′ and interest rate i$′. Suppose the price level increases, ceteris \\nparibus. Again, the ceteris paribus assumption means that we assume all other exogenous variables in the \\nmodel remain fixed at their original levels. In this exercise, it means that the money supply (MS) and real \\nGDP (Y$) remain fixed. An increase in the price level (P$) causes a decrease in the real money supply \\n(MS/P$) since MS remains constant. In the adjoining diagram, this is shown as a shift from  MS/P$′ \\nto MS/P$″. At the original interest \\nrate, i$′, the real money supply has \\nfallen to level 2 along the horizontal \\naxis, while real money demand \\nremains at level 1. This means that \\nmoney demand exceeds money \\nsupply and the actual interest rate is \\nlower than the new equilibrium rate. \\nAdjustment to the higher interest rate \\nwill follow the “interest rate too low” \\nequilibrium story. \\nMore intuition concerning these \\neffects arises if one recalls that price \\nFigure 7.4 Effects of a Price Level Increase \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn how a change in real GDP affects the equilibrium interest rate. \\nFinally, let’s consider the effects of an increase in real gross domestic product (GDP). Such an increase \\nrepresents economic growth. Thus the study of the effects of a real GDP increase is the same as asking \\nhow economic growth will affect interest rates. \\nGDP may increase for a variety of reasons, which are discussed in subsequent chapters. For now, we will \\nimagine that GDP increases for some unspecified reason and consider the consequences of such a change \\nin the money market. \\nSuppose the money market is originally in equilibrium at point A in Figure 7.5 \"Effects of an Increase in \\nReal GDP\" with real money supply MS/P$ and interest rate i$′.

In this exercise, it means that the money supply (MS) and the \\nprice level (P$) remain fixed. An increase in GDP will raise the demand for money because people will \\nneed more money to make the transactions necessary to purchase the new GDP. In other words, real \\nmoney demand rises due to the transactions demand effect. This increase is reflected in the rightward \\nshift of the real money demand \\nfunction from L(i$, Y$′) \\nto L(i$, Y$″). \\nAt the original interest rate, i$′, \\nreal money demand has \\nincreased to level 2 along the \\nhorizontal axis while real money \\nsupply remains at level 1.

Integrate the money market with the foreign exchange market and highlight the interactions \\nthat exist between the two. \\nIn this section, we will integrate the money market with the foreign exchange market to demonstrate the \\ninteractions that exist between the two. First, let’s review. \\nIn the money market, the endogenous variable is the interest rate (i$). This is the variable that is \\ndetermined in equilibrium in the model. The exogenous variables are the money supply ( MS), the price \\nlevel (P$), and the level of real gross domestic product (GDP) (Y). These variables are determined outside \\nthe money market and treated as known values. Their values determine the supply and demand for money \\nand affect the equilibrium value of the interest rate. \\nIn the foreign exchange (Forex) market, the endogenous variable is the exchange rate, E$/£. The exogenous \\nvariables are the domestic interest \\nrate (i$), the foreign interest rate \\n(i£), and the expected exchange \\nrate (E$/£e). Their values \\ndetermine the domestic and \\nforeign rates of return and affect \\nthe equilibrium value of the \\nexchange rate. \\nThe linkage between the two \\nmarkets arises because the \\ndomestic interest rate is the \\nendogenous variable in the money \\nmarket and an exogenous variable \\nin the Forex market.

The decrease in the U.S. interest \\nrate causes a decrease in the rate of return on dollar \\nassets: RoR$ shifts from RoR$′ to RoR$″ (step 3). \\nFinally, the reduction in the dollar rate of return \\ncauses an increase in the exchange rate \\nfrom E′$/£ to E″$/£ (step 4).

Understand the conditions under which changes in the money supply will have a long-run impact \\non the price level and hence the inflation rate in a country. \\nIn previous sections we assumed that price levels were given exogenously and were unaffected by changes \\nin other variables. In this section, we will argue that money supply increases tend to have a pos itive effect \\non the price level and thus the rate of inflation in an economy. This effect is unlikely to occur quickly, \\ninstead arising over several months or years. For this reason, we will say the effect occurs in the  long run. \\nThe magnitude of the price level effect is also greatly influenced by the level of unemployment in the \\neconomy. Unemployment affects the degree to which the money increase affects prices and the degree to \\nwhich it affects output. \\nThe easiest way to see the linkage between money supply and prices is to simplify the story by assuming \\noutput cannot change. We tell that in story 1. This assumption allows us to isolate the impact of money on \\nprices alone. In the subsequent adjustment stories, we’ll relax the fixed output assumption to show how \\nmoney increases can also affect the level of output in an economy. \\nStory 1: Money Supply Increase with Extreme Full Employment \\nHere we’ll consider the effects of a money supply increase assuming what I’ll call “extreme full \\nemployment.” Extreme full employment means that every person who wishes to work within the economy \\nis employed. In addition, each working person is working the maximum number of hours that he or she is \\nwilling to work. In terms of capital usage, this too is assumed to be maximally employed. All machinery, \\nequipment, office space, land, and so on that can be employed in production is currently being used. \\nExtreme full employment describes a situation where it is physically impossible to produce any more  \\noutput with the resources currently available. \\nNext, let’s imagine the central bank increases the money supply by purchasing U.S. government Treasury \\nbills (T-bills) in the open market. Suppose the transaction is made with a commercial bank that decides to \\nsell some of its portfolio of Treasury bills to free reserves to make loans to businesses. The transaction \\ntransfers the T-bill certificate to the central bank in exchange for an accounting notation the central bank \\nmakes in the bank’s reserve account.

Thus these new reserves are available for the \\nbank to lend out. \\nLet’s suppose the value of the T-bills transacted is $10 million. Suppose the bank decides to lend the $10 \\nmillion to Ford Motor Corporation, which is planning to build a new corporate office building. When the \\nloan is made, the bank will create a demand deposit account in Ford’s name, which the company can use \\nto pay its building expenses. Only after the creation of the $10 million demand deposit account is there an \\nactual increase in the money supply. \\nWith money in the bank, Ford will now begin the process of spending to construct the office building. This \\nwill involve hiring a construction company. However, Ford will now run into a problem given our \\nassumption of extreme full employment. There are no construction companies available to begin \\nconstruction on their building. All the construction workers and the construction equipment are already \\nbeing used at their maximum capacity. There is no leeway. \\nNonetheless, Ford has $10 million sitting in the bank ready to be spent and it wants its building started. \\nSo what can it do? \\nIn this situation, the demand for construction services in the economy exceeds the supply. Profit-seeking \\nconstruction companies that learn that Ford is seeking to begin building as soon as possible, can offer the \\nfollowing deal: “Pay us more than we are earning on our other construction projects and we’ll stop \\nworking there and come over to build your building.” Other construction companies may offer a similar \\ndeal. Once the companies, whose construction projects have already started, learn that their construction \\ncompanies are considering abandoning them for a better offer from Ford, they will likely respond by \\nincreasing their payments to their construction crews to prevent them from fleeing to Ford. Companies \\nthat cannot afford to raise their payments will be the ones that must cease their construction, and their \\nconstruction company will flee to Ford. Note that another assumption we must make for this story to work \\nis that there are no enforceable contracts between the construction company and its client. If there were, a \\ncompany that flees to Ford will find itself being sued for breach of contract. Indeed, this is one of the \\nreasons why contracts are necessary. If all works out perfectly, the least productive construction projects \\nwill cease operations since these companies are the ones that are unwilling to raise their wages to keep the \\nconstruction firm from fleeing.

However, Ford’s payments to the construction company \\nare higher now. This means some workers or owners in the construction company are going home with a \\nfatter paycheck. Other construction companies are also receiving higher payments so wages and rents will \\nlikely be higher for them as well. \\nOther companies that have hired the construction firms now face a dilemma, however. Higher payments \\nhave to come from somewhere. These firms may respond by increasing the prices of their products for \\ntheir customers. For example, if this other firm is Coca-Cola, which must now pay higher prices to \\ncomplete its construction project, it most probably will raise the price of Coke to pay for its higher over all \\nproduction costs. Hence increases in wages and rents to construction companies will begin to cause \\nincreases in market prices of other products, such as Coke, televisions, computers, and so on.  \\nAt the same time, workers and owners of the construction companies with higher wages will undoubtedly \\nspend more. Thus they will go out and demand more restaurant meals, cameras, and dance lessons and a \\nwhole host of other products. The restaurants, camera makers, and dance companies will experience a \\nslight increase in demand for their products. However, due to the assumption of extreme full \\nemployment, they have no ability to increase their supply in response to the increase in demand. Thus \\nthese companies will do what the profit-seeking construction companies did before…they will raise their \\nprices. \\nThus price increases will begin to ripple through the economy as the extra money enters the circular flow, \\nresulting in demand increases. As prices for final products begin to rise, workers may begin to demand \\nhigher wages to keep up with the rising cost of living. These wage increases will in turn lead firms to raise \\nthe prices of their outputs, leading to another round of increases in wages and prices. This process is \\nknown as the wage-price spiral. \\nNowhere in this process can there ever be more production or output. That’s because of our assumption of \\nextreme full employment. We have assumed it is physically impossible to produce any more.

Another way of \\nsaying this is that money supply increases are inflationary. \\nThe increase in prices will not occur immediately. It will take time for the construction companies to work \\nout their new payment scheme. It will take more time for them to receive their extra wages and rents and \\nbegin spending them. It will take more time, still, for the restaurants and camera makers and others to \\nrespond to higher demands. And it will take even more time for workers to respond to the increases in \\nprices and to demand higher wages. The total time may be several years before an economy can get back \\nto equilibrium. For this reason, we think about this money supply effect on the price level as a long -run \\neffect. In other words, we say an increase in the money supply will lead to an increase in the price  level in \\nthe long run. \\nInflation arises whenever there is too much money chasing too few goods. This effect is easy to recognize \\nin this example since output does not change when the money supply increases. So, in this example, there \\nis more money chasing the same quantity of output. Inflation can also arise if there is less output given a \\nfixed amount of money. This is an effect seen in the transition economies of the former Soviet Union. \\nAfter the breakdown of the political system in the early 1990s, output dropped precipitously, while money \\nin circulation remained much the same. The outcome was a very rapid inflation. In these cases, it was the \\nsame amount of money chasing fewer goods. \\nStory 2: Money Supply Increase with High Unemployment \\nIn this story, we relax the assumption of extreme full employment and assume instead that there is a very \\nhigh rate of unemployment in the economy. This example will show how money supply increases can \\naffect national output as well as prices. \\nSuppose there is a money supply increase as in the previous story. When Ford Motor Company goes out \\nlooking for a construction company to hire, there is now an important new possibility. Since \\nunemployment is very high, it is likely that most construction companies are not operating  at their full \\ncapacity. Some companies may have laid off workers in the recent past due to a lack of demand. The \\nconstruction company that wins the Ford contract will not have to give up other construction projects. \\nInstead, it can simply expand output by hiring unemployed workers and capital.

Thus there is  no pressure \\nto increase wages or the prices of construction services. \\nIt is true, there is more money being paid out in wages by this company, and the new workers will go out \\nand spend that money, leading to an increase in demand for restaurant services, cameras, dance lessons, \\nand other products. These companies are also likely to respond by hiring more workers and idle \\nequipment to provide more restaurant meals, cameras, and dance lessons. Here too, with a ready and \\nwilling source of new inputs from the ranks of the unemployed, these companies will not have an \\nincentive to raise wages, rents, or prices. Instead, they will provide more output of goods and services.  \\nThus as the increase in money ripples through the economy, it will stimulate demand for a wi de variety of \\nproducts. However, because of high unemployment, the money supply increase need not result in higher \\nprices. Instead, national output increases and the unemployment rate falls.  \\nA comparison of stories 1 and 2 highlights the importance of the unemployment rate in determining the \\nextent to which a money supply increase will be inflationary. In general, we can conclude that an increase \\nin the money supply will raise the domestic price level to a larger degree in the long run, thus lowering the \\nunemployment rate of labor and capital. \\nNatural Rate of Unemployment \\nEconomists typically say that an economy is at full employment output when the unemployment rate is at \\nthe natural rate. The natural rate is defined as the rate that does not cause inflationary pressures in the \\neconomy. It is a rate that allows for common transitions that characterize labor markets. For example, \\nsome people are currently unemployed because they have recently finished school and are looking for \\ntheir first job. Some are unemployed because they have quit one job and are in search of another. Some \\npeople have decided to move to another city, and are unemployed during the transition. Finally, some \\npeople may have lost a job in a company that has closed or downsized and may spend a few weeks or \\nmonths in search of their next job. \\nThese types of transitions are always occurring in the labor market and are known as frictional (or \\ntransitional) unemployment. When employment surveys are conducted each month, they will always \\nidentify a group of people unemployed for these reasons. They count as unemployed, since they are all \\nactively seeking work.

Thus there is a constant turnover of \\npeople in this group and thus a natural unemployment rate. [1] \\nThere is no simple way to measure the natural rate of unemployment. It will likely vary with economic \\nconditions and the fluidity of the labor market. Nonetheless, economists estimate the natural rate of \\nunemployment to be around 5 percent in the United States today.  \\nWhen economists talk about the inflationary effect of money supply increases, they typically refer to the \\nnatural rate of unemployment. A money supply increase will likely be inflationary when the \\nunemployment rate is below the natural rate. In contrast, inflationary effects of money supply increases \\nare reduced if the economy has unemployment above the natural rate. Here’s how the story would work. \\nStory 3: Money Supply Increase above and below the Natural Unemployment \\nRate \\nSuppose there is a money supply increase as in the previous story, but now let’s assume the economy is \\noperating above full employment, meaning that unemployment is below its natural rate.  \\nAs the money supply increase ripples through the economy causing excess demand, as described above, \\nbusinesses have some leeway to expand output. Since unemployment is not zero, they can look to hire \\nunemployed workers and expand output. However, as frictional unemployment decreases, the labor \\nmarket will pick up speed. Graduating students looking for their first job will find one quickly. Workers \\nmoving to another job will also find one quickly. In an effort to get the best worke rs, firms may begin to \\nraise their wage offers. Workers in transition may quickly find themselves entertaining several job offers, \\nrather than just one. These workers will begin to demand higher wages. Ultimately, higher wages and \\nrents will result in higher output prices, which in turn will inspire demands for higher wages. Thus despite \\nthe existence of some unemployment, the money supply increase may increase output slightly but it is \\nalso likely to be inflationary. \\nIn contrast, suppose the economy were operating with unemployment above the natural rate. In this case, \\nthe increase in demand caused by a money supply increase is likely to have a more significant effect upon \\noutput. As firms try to expand output, they will face a much larger pool of potential employees. \\nCompetition by several workers for one new job will put power back in the hands of the company, \\nallowing it to hire the best quality worker without having to raise its wage offer to do so. Thus, in general, \\noutput will increase more and prices will increase less, if at all.

Understand the structure and results of the basic Keynesian model of national output \\ndetermination. \\nThis chapter describes how the supply and demand for the national output of goods and services combine \\nto determine the equilibrium level of national output for an economy. The model is called the goods and \\nservices market model, or just the G&S market model. \\nIn this model, we use gross national product (GNP) as the measure of national output rather than gross \\ndomestic product (GDP). This adjustment is made because we wish to define the trade balance ( EX − IM) \\nas the current account (defined as the difference between exports and imports of goods, services inc omes \\npayments/receipts, and unilateral transfers). This adjustment is discussed in more detail in  Section 8.6 \\n\"Export and Import Demand\". \\nThe diagram used to display this model is commonly known as the Keynesian cross. The model assumes, \\nfor simplicity, that the amount of national output produced by an economy is determined by the total \\namount demanded. Thus if, for some reason, the demand for GNP were to rise, then the amount of GNP \\nsupplied would rise up to satisfy it. If demand for the GNP falls — for whatever reason— then supply of \\nGNP would also fall. Consequently, it is useful to think of this model as “demand driven.” \\nThe model is developed by identifying the key determinants of GNP demand. The starting point is the \\nnational income identity, which states that \\nGNP = C + I + G + EX − IM, \\nthat is, the gross national product is the sum of consumption expenditures ( C), investment expenditures \\n(I), government spending (G), and exports (EX) minus imports (IM). \\nNote that the identity uses GNP rather than GDP if we define EX and IM to include income payments, \\nincome receipts, and unilateral transfers as well as goods and services trade.  \\nWe rewrite this relationship as \\nAD = CD + ID + GD + EXD − IMD, \\nwhere AD refers to aggregate demand for the GNP and the right-side variables are now read as \\nconsumption demand, investment demand, and so on. The model further assumes that consumption \\ndemand is positively related to changes indisposable income (Yd).

Furthermore, since the domestic real currency value is negatively related to the domestic price \\nlevel (inflation) and positively related to the foreign price level, these variables will also affect current \\naccount demand. \\nUsing the G&S market model, several important relationships between key economic variables are shown:  \\n• When government demand (G) or investment demand (I) for G&S rises (falls), equilibrium GNP rises \\n(falls). \\n• When disposable income rises (falls) due to a decrease (increase) in taxes or an increase (decrease) in \\ntransfer payments, equilibrium GNP increases (decreases). \\n• When the real exchange rate depreciates (appreciates), either due to a depreciation of the nominal \\nexchange rate, an increase in the domestic price level, or a decrease in the foreign price level, equilibrium \\nGNP rises (falls). \\nConnections \\nThe G&S market model connects with the money market because the value of GN P determined in the G&S \\nmodel affects money demand. If equilibrium GNP rises in the G&S model, then money demand will rise, \\ncausing an increase in the interest rate. \\nThe G&S model also connects with the foreign exchange (Forex) market. The equilibrium exch ange rate \\ndetermined in the Forex affects the real exchange rate that in turn influences demand on the current \\naccount. \\nA thorough discussion of these interrelationships is given in Chapter 9 \"The AA-DD Model\". \\nOmissions  \\nThere is one important relationship omitted in this version of the G&S model, and that is the relationship \\nbetween interest rates and investment. In most standard depictions of the Keynesian G&S model, it is \\nassumed that increases (decreases) in interest rates will reduce (increase) demand for investment. In this \\nversion of the model, to keep things simple, investment is assumed to be exogenous (determined in an \\nexternal process) and unrelated to the level of interest rates.

Learn that aggregate demand is the summation of the separate demands for each variable in the \\nnational income identity. \\nThe Keynesian model of aggregate demand for goods and services is developed by identifying key \\ndeterminants of demand for the national output. When we talk about aggregate  demand (AD), it means \\ndemand by households, businesses, and the government for anything and everything produced within the \\neconomy. The starting point is the national income identity, which states that  \\nGNP = C + I + G + EX − IM, \\nthat is, the gross national product is the sum of consumption expenditures, investment expenditures, \\ngovernment spending, and exports minus imports of goods and services.  \\nWe rewrite this relationship as \\nAD = CD + ID + GD + EXD − IMD, \\nwhere the left side, AD, refers to aggregate demand for the GNP and the right-side variables are read as \\nconsumption demand, investment demand, and so on. Determinants of the right -side variables will be \\nconsidered in turn. \\nIt is important to remember that demand is merely what households, businesses, and the government \\n“would like” to purchase given the conditions that exist in the economy. Sometimes demand will be \\nrealized, as when the economy is in equilibrium, but sometimes demand will not be satisfied. On the other \\nhand, the variable Y, for real GNP, represents the aggregate supply of G&S. This will correspond to the \\nactual GNP whether in equilibrium or not. \\nNext, we’ll present the determinants of each demand term: consumption, investment, government, and \\nexport and import demand. \\nKEY TAKEAWAY  \\n• In the G&S model, aggregate demand for the GNP is the sum of consumption demand, \\ninvestment demand, government demand, and current account demand. \\nEXERCISE  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn the determinants of consumption demand and the effects of changes in these variables. \\nConsumption demand represents the demand for goods and services by individuals and households in the \\neconomy. This is the major category in the national income accounts for most countries, typically \\ncomprising from 50 percent to 70 percent of the gross national product (GNP) for most countries.  \\nIn this model, the main determinant of consumption demand is disposable income. Disposable income is \\nall the income households have at their disposal to spend. It is defined as national income (GNP) minus \\ntaxes taken away by the government, plus transfer payments that the government pays out to people. \\nMore formally, this is written as \\nYd = Y − T + TR, \\nwhere Yd refers to disposable income, Y is real GNP, T is taxes, and TR represents transfer payments. \\nIn this relationship, disposable income is defined in the same way as in the circular flow diagram \\npresented in Chapter 2 \"National Income and the Balance of Payments Accounts\", Section 2.7 \"The Twin-\\nDeficit Identity\". Recall that taxes withdrawn from GNP are assumed to be all taxes collected by the \\ngovernment from all sources. Thus income taxes, social insurance taxes, profit taxes, sales taxes, and \\nproperty taxes are all assumed to be included in taxes (T). Also, transfer payments refer to all payments \\nmade by the government that do not result in the provision of a good or service. All social insurance \\npayments, welfare payments, and unemployment compensation, among other things, are included in \\ntransfers (TR). \\nIn the G&S model, demand for consumption G&S is assumed to be positively related to disposable \\nincome. This means that when disposable income rises, demand for consumption G&S will also rise, and \\nvice versa. This makes sense since households who have more money to spend will quite likely wish to buy \\nmore G&S. \\nWe can write consumption demand in a functional form as follows: \\n \\nThis expression says that consumption demand is a function CD that depends positively (+) on disposable \\nincome (Yd).

It is a more complete way of writing the function. Note well that CD here denotes a function, not a \\nvariable. The expression is the same as if we had written f(x), but instead we substitute a CD for the f \\nand Yd for the x. \\nIt is always important to keep track of which variables are exogenous and which are endogenous. In this \\nmodel, real GNP (Y) is the key endogenous variable since it will be determined in the equilibrium. Taxes \\n(T) and transfer payments (TR) are exogenous variables, determined outside the model. Since \\nconsumption demand CD is dependent on the value of Y, which is endogenous, CD is also endogenous. By \\nthe same logic, Yd is endogenous as well. \\nLinear Consumption Function \\nIt is common in most introductory textbooks to present the consumption function in linear form. For our \\npurposes here, this is not absolutely necessary, but doing so will allow us to present a few important \\npoints. \\nIn linear form, the consumption function is written as \\n \\nHere C0 represents autonomous consumption and mpc refers to the marginal propensity to consume. \\nAutonomous consumption (C0) is the amount of consumption that would be demanded even if income \\nwere zero. (Autonomous simply means “independent” of income.) Graphically, it corresponds to the y-\\nintercept of the linear function. Autonomous consumption will be positive since households will spend \\nsome money (drawing on savings if necessary) to purchase consumption goods (like food) even if income \\nwere zero. \\nThe marginal propensity to consume (mpc) represents the additional (or marginal) demand for G&S given \\nan additional dollar of disposable income. Graphically, it corresponds to the slope of the consumption \\nfunction. This variable must be in the range of zero to one and is most likely to be between 0.5 and 0.8 for \\nmost economies. If mpc were equal to one, then households would spend every additional dollar of \\nincome. However, because most households put some of their income into savings (i.e., into the bank, or \\npensions), not every extra dollar of income will lead to a dollar increase in consumption demand. That \\nfraction of the dollar not used for consumption but put into savings is called the \\nmarginal propensity to save (mps). Since each additional dollar must be spent or saved, the following \\nrelationship must hold: \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn the determinants of investment demand and the effects of changes in these variables. \\nInvestment demand refers to the demand by businesses for physical capital goods and services used to \\nmaintain or expand its operations. Think of it as the office and factory space, machinery, computers, \\ndesks, and so on that are used to operate a business. It is important to remember that investment demand \\nhere does not refer to financial investment. Financial investment is a form of saving, typically by \\nhouseholds that wish to maintain or increase their wealth by deferring consumption till a later time.  \\nIn this model, investment demand will be assumed to be exogenous. This means that its value is \\ndetermined outside of the model and is not dependent on any variable wit hin the model. This assumption \\nis made primarily to simplify the analysis and to allow the focus to be on exchange rate changes later. The \\nsimple equation for investment demand can be written as \\nID = I0, \\nwhere the “0,” or naught, subscript on the right side indicates that the variable is exogenous or \\nautonomous. In words, the equation says that investment demand is given exogenously as I 0. \\nAdmittedly, this is not a realistic assumption. In many other macro models, investment demand  is \\nassumed to depend on two other aggregate variables: GNP and interest rates. GNP may affect investment \\ndemand since the total demand for business expansion is more likely the higher the total size of the \\neconomy. The growth rate of GNP may also be an associated determinant since the faster GNP is growing, \\nthe more likely companies will predict better business in the future, inspiring more investment.  \\nInterest rates can affect investment demand because many businesses must borrow money to finance \\nexpansions. The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money; thus, the higher the interest rates are, the \\nlower the investment demand should be, and vice versa. \\nIf we included the GNP and interest rate effects into the model, the solution to the extended model la ter \\nwould prove to be much more difficult. Thus we simplify things by assuming that investment is \\nexogenous. Since many students have learned about the GNP and interest rate effect in previous courses, \\nyou need to remember that these effects are not a part of this model. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn the determinants of government demand and the effects of changes in these variables. \\nGovernment demand refers to the government’s demand for goods and services produced in the economy. \\nIn some cases this demand is for G&S produced by private businesses, as when the government purchases \\na naval aircraft. Other government demand is actually produced by the government itself, as what o ccurs \\nwith teachers providing educational services in the public schools. All levels of government demand —\\nfederal, state, and local— are included in this demand term. Excluded are transfer payments such as social \\ninsurance, welfare assistance, and unemployment compensation. \\nIn this model, government demand is treated the same way as investment demand: it is assumed to be \\nexogenous. This means that its value is determined outside of the model and is not dependent on any \\nvariable within the model. A simple equation for government demand can be written as \\n \\nGD = G0, \\nwhere the “0,” or naught, subscript on the right side indicates that the variable is exogenous or \\nautonomous. In words, the equation says that government demand is given exogenously as G 0. \\nThis is a more common assumption in many other macro models, even though one could argue \\ndependencies of government demand on GNP and interest rates. However, these linkages are not likely to \\nbe as strong as with investment, thus assuming exogeneity here is a more r ealistic assumption than with \\ninvestment. \\nKEY TAKEAWAY  \\n• In the G&S model, government demand is assumed to be exogenous, meaning not dependent on \\nany other variable within the model such as GNP or interest rates. \\nEXERCISE  \\n1.

Learn the determinants of export and import demand and the effects of changes in these \\nvariables. \\nExport demand refers to the demand by foreign countries for G&S produced domestically. Ultimately, \\nthese goods are exported to foreign residents. Import demand refers to demand by domestic residents for \\nforeign-produced G&S. Imported G&S are not a part of domestic GNP. Recall from  Chapter 2 \"National \\nIncome and the Balance of Payments Accounts\", Section 2.3 \"U.S. National Income Statistics (2007–\\n2008)\"that imports are subtracted from the national income identity because they are included as a part \\nof consumption, investment, and government expenditures as well as in exports. Likewise in this model, \\nconsumption, investment, government, and export demand are assumed to include demand for imported \\ngoods. Thus imports must be subtracted to assure that only domesticall y produced G&S are included. \\nWe will define current account demand as CAD = EXD − IMD. The key determinants of current account \\ndemand in this model are assumed to be the domestic real currency value and disposable income.  \\nFirst, let’s define the real currency value, then show how it relates to the demand for exports and imports. \\nThe real British pound value in terms of U.S. dollars (also called the  real exchange rate between dollars \\nand pounds), RE$/£, is a measure of the cost of a market basket of goods abroad relative to the cost of a \\nsimilar basket domestically. It captures differences in prices, converted at the spot exchange rate, between \\nthe domestic country and the rest of the world. It is defined as \\n \\nwhere E$/£ is the spot exchange rate, CB£ is the cost of a market basket of goods in Britain, and CB$ is the \\ncost of a comparable basket of goods in the United States. The top expression,  E$/£ CB£, represents the \\ncost of a British market basket of goods converted to U.S. dollars. Thus if  RE$/£ > 1, then a British basket \\nof goods costs more than a comparable U.S. basket of goods. If RE$/£ < 1, then a U.S. basket of goods costs \\nmore than a British basket. Also note that RE$/£ is a unit less number. If RE$/£ = 2, for example, it means \\nthat British goods cost twice as much as U.S. goods, on average, at the current spot exchange rate.  \\nNote that we could also have defined the reciprocal real exchange rate,  RE£/$. This real exchange rate is \\nthe real value of the pound in terms of U.S. dollars.

Thus it is always \\npreferable to say the real dollar value rises, or the real pound value falls, since this eliminates any \\npotential confusion. In this text, I will always adhere to the convention of writing the spot exchange rate \\nand the real exchange rate with the U.S. dollar in the numerator. Thus references to the real exchange rate \\nin this text will always refer to that form. \\nSince the cost of a market basket of goods is used to create a country’s price index, changes in CB will \\nmove together with changes in the country’s price level P. For this reason, it is common to rewrite the real \\nexchange rate using price levels rather than costs of market baskets and to continue to interpret the \\nexpression in the same way. For more information related to this, see Chapter 6 \"Purchasing Power \\nParity\", Section 6.2 \"The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and PPP\". We will follow that convention here and \\nrewrite RE$/£ as  \\n \\nwhere P£ is the British price index and P$ is the U.S. price index. From this point forward, we’ll mean this \\nexpression whenever we discuss the real exchange rate. \\nNext, we’ll discuss the connection to current account demand. To understand the relationship it is best to \\nconsider a change in the real exchange rate. Suppose RE$/£rises. This means that the real value of the \\npound rises and, simultaneously, the real U.S. dollar value falls. This also means that goods and services \\nare becoming relatively more expensive, on average, in Britain compared to the United States.  \\nRelatively cheaper G&S in the United States will tend to encourage U. S. exports since the British would \\nprefer to buy some cheaper products in the United States. Similarly, relatively more expensive British \\nG&S will tend to discourage U.S. imports from Britain. Since U.S. exports will rise and imports will fall \\nwith an increase in the real U.S. dollar value, current account demand, CAD = EXD − IMD, will rise. \\nSimilarly, if the real U.S. dollar value falls, U.S. exports will fall and imports rise, causing a decrease \\nin CAD. Hence, there is a positive relationship between this real exchange rate (i.e., the real value of the \\npound) and U.S. current account demand. \\nDisposable income can also affect the current account demand. In this case, the effect is through imports. \\nAn increase in disposable income means that households have more money to spend.

Combine the individual demand functions into an aggregate demand (AD) function. \\nNotice that the right side indicates that if disposable income were to rise, consumption demand would rise \\nbut current account demand, which is negatively related to disposable income, would fall. This would \\nseem to make ambiguous the effect of a disposable income change on aggregate demand. However, by \\nthinking carefully about the circular flow definitions, we can recall that consumption expenditures consist \\nof the sum of expenditures on domestically produced goods and imported goods. This was the reason \\nimports are subtracted away in the national income identity. This also means that the marginal propensity \\nto spend on imported goods must be lower than the total marginal propensity to consume, agai n since \\nimports are a fraction of total consumption spending. This implies that the negative effect on imports \\nfrom a $1 increase in disposable income must be less than the positive impact on consumption demand.  \\nWe indicate the net positive effect on aggregate demand of changes in disposable income with the “+” sign \\nabove Yd on the left-hand side. The positive impact of changes in the real exchange rate, investment \\ndemand, and government demand is obvious and is also shown. \\nWe can write the aggregate demand function in several different ways. To be more explicit, we can include \\nall the fundamental variables affecting aggregate demand by writing out the disposable income and real \\nexchange rate terms as follows: \\n \\nWriting the expression in this way allows us to indicate that the spot exchange rate, the price levels \\ndomestically and abroad, and domestic taxes and transfer payments also affect aggregate demand. For \\nexample, increases in autonomous transfer payments will raise aggregate demand since it raises \\ndisposable income, which in turn raises demand. Increases in taxes, however, will lower disposable \\nincome, which in turn will lower aggregate demand. Similarly, an increase in the spot exchange rate (as \\ndefined) or the foreign price level will raise aggregate demand, since both changes will increase the real \\nexchange rate. However, an increase in the domestic price level will reduce the real exchange rate \\n(because it is in the denominator) and thus reduce aggregate demand.  \\nKEY TAKEAWAY  \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn how to use the Keynesian cross diagram to describe equilibrium in the G&S market. \\nThe Keynesian cross diagram depicts the equilibrium level of national income in the G&S market model. \\nWe begin with a plot of the aggregate demand function with respect to real GNP (Y) in . Real GNP (Y) is \\nplotted along the horizontal axis, and aggregate demand is measured along the vertical axis. The aggregate \\ndemand function is shown as the upward sloping line labeled AD(Y, …). The (…) is meant to indicate \\nthat AD is a function of many other variables not listed. There are several important assumptions about \\nthe form of the AD function that are needed to assure an equilibrium. We discuss each assumption in \\nturn. \\nFirst, the AD function is \\npositively sloped with \\nrespect to changes in Y, \\nceteris paribus. Recall that \\nceteris paribus means that \\nall other variables affecting \\naggregate demand are \\nassumed to remain constant \\nas GNP changes. The \\npositive slope arises from \\nthe rationale given \\npreviously that an increase \\nin disposable income should \\nnaturally lead to an increase in consumption demand and a smaller decrease in CA demand, resulting in a \\nnet increase in aggregate demand. Next, if GNP rises, ceteris paribus, it means that taxes and transfer \\npayments remain fixed and disposable income must increase. Thus an increase in GNP leads to an \\nincrease in AD. \\nSecond, the AD function has a positive vertical intercept term. In other words, the AD function crosses the \\nvertical axis at a level greater than zero. For reasons that are not too important, this feature is critical for \\nFigure 8.1 Aggregate Demand Function \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The reason it arises is because autonomous consumption, investment, \\nand government demand are all assumed to be independent of income and positive in value. These \\nassumptions guarantee a positive vertical intercept. \\nThird, the AD function has a slope that is less than one. This assumption means that for every $1 increase \\nin GNP (Y), there is a less than $1 increase in aggregate demand. This arises because the marginal \\npropensity to consume domestic GNP is less than one for two reasons. First, some of the additional \\nincome will be spent on imported goods, and second, some of the additional in come will be saved. Thus \\nthe AD function will have a slope less than one. \\nAlso plotted in the diagram is a line labeled AD = Y. This line is also sometimes called the forty-five-\\ndegree line since it sits at a forty-five-degree angle to the horizontal axis. This line represents all the points \\non the diagram where AD equals GNP. Since GNP can be thought of as aggregate supply, the forty -five-\\ndegree line contains all the points where AD equals aggregate supply.  \\nBecause of the assumptions about the shape and position of the AD function, AD will cross the forty-five-\\ndegree line, only once, from above. The intersection determines the equilibrium value of GNP, labeled  Y′ \\nin the diagram. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The Keynesian cross diagram plots the aggregate demand function versus GNP together with a \\nforty-five-degree line representing the set of points where AD =GNP. The intersection of these \\ntwo lines represents equilibrium GNP in the economy. \\n• An equilibrium exists if the AD function crosses the forty-five-degree line from above. \\nThis occurs if three conditions hold: \\n1. The AD function has a positive slope. (It does.) \\n2. The AD function has a slope less than one. (It does.) \\n3. The AD function intersects the vertical axis in the positive range.

Learn the equilibrium stories in the G&S market that describe how GNP adjusts when it is not at \\nits equilibrium value. \\nAny equilibrium in economics has an associated behavioral story to explain the forces that will move the \\nendogenous variable to the equilibrium value. In the G&S market model, the endogenous variable is  Y, \\nreal GNP. This is the variable that will change to achieve the equilibrium. Variables that do not change in \\nthe adjustment to the equilibrium are the exogenous variables. In this model, the exogenous variables \\nare I0,G0, T, TR, E$/£, P$, and P£. (If one uses a linear consumption demand function, theC0 and mpc are \\nalso exogenous.) Changes in the exogenous variables are necessary to cause an adjustment to a new \\nequilibrium. However, in telling an equilibrium story, it is typical to simply assume that the endogenous \\nvariable is not at the equilibrium (for some unstated reason) and then to explain how and why the variable \\nwill adjust to the equilibrium value. \\nGNP Too High \\nSuppose for some reason actual GNP, Y1, is higher than the equilibrium GNP, Y′, as shown in Figure 8.2 \\n\"G&S Market Adjustment to Equilibrium: GNP Too High\". In this case, aggregate demand is read from \\nthe AD function as AD(Y1) along the vertical axis. We project aggregate supply, Y1, to the vertical axis using \\nthe forty-five-degree line so that we can \\ncompare supply with demand. This \\nhelps us to see that Y1 > AD(Y1)— that is, \\naggregate supply is greater than \\naggregate demand. \\nWe now tell what can be called the \\n“Inventory Story.” When total demand is \\nless than supply, goods will begin to pile \\nup on the shelves in stores. That’s \\nbecause at current prices (and all other \\nfixed exogenous parameters), \\nhouseholds, businesses, and \\nFigure 8.2 G&S Market Adjustment to Equilibrium: GNP \\nToo High \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Thus inventories begin to r ise. \\nMerchants, faced with storerooms filling up, send orders for fewer goods to producers. Producers respond \\nto fewer orders by producing less, and thus GNP begins to fall. \\nAs GNP falls, disposable income also falls, which causes a drop in aggregate deman d as well. In the \\ndiagram, this is seen as a movement along the AD curve from Y1 to Y′. However, GNP falls at a faster rate, \\nalong the AD = Y line in the diagram. Eventually, the drop in aggregate supply catches up to the drop in \\ndemand when the equilibrium is reached at Y′. At this point, aggregate demand equals aggregate supply \\nand there is no longer an accumulation of inventories. \\nIt is important to recognize a common perception or intuition that does not hold in the equilibrium \\nadjustment process. Many students imagine a case of rising inventories and ask, “Won’t producers just \\nlower their prices to get rid of the excess?” In real-world situations this will frequently happen; however, \\nthat response violates the ceteris paribus assumption of this model. We assume here that the U.S. price \\nlevel (P$) and consequently all prices in the economy remain fixed in the adjustment to the new \\nequilibrium. Later, with more elaborate versions of the model, some price flexibility is considered.  \\nGNP Too Low \\nSuppose for some reason, actual \\nGNP, Y2, is lower than the \\nequilibrium GNP, Y′, as shown \\nin Figure 8.3 \"G&S Market \\nAdjustment to Equilibrium: \\nGNP Too Low\". In this case, \\naggregate demand is read from \\nthe AD function as AD(Y2) along \\nthe vertical axis. We project \\naggregate supply (Y2) to the \\nvertical axis using the forty-five-\\ndegree line. This shows that AD(Y2) > Y2— that is, aggregate demand is greater than aggregate supply.  \\nWhen total demand exceeds supply, inventories of goods that had previously been accumulated will begin \\nto deplete in stores. That’s because, at current prices (and all other fixed exogenous parameters), \\nFigure 8.3 G&S Market Adjustment to Equilibrium: GNP Too Low \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn how a change in government demand affects equilibrium GNP. \\nSuppose the economy is initially in equilibrium in the G&S market with government demand at \\nlevel G1 and real GNP at Y1, shown in Figure 8.4 \"Effect of an Increase in Government Demand in the G&S \\nMarket\". The initial AD function is written as AD(…, G1, …) to signify the level of government demand and \\nto denote that other variables affect AD and are at some initial and unspecified values.  \\nNext, suppose the government \\nraises demand for G&S \\nfrom G1 to G2, ceteris paribus. The \\nincrease might arise because a \\nnew budget is passed by the \\nlegislature with new spending \\ninitiatives. The ceteris paribus \\nassumption means that all other \\nexogenous variables are assumed to \\nremain fixed. Most importantly in this \\ncontext, this means that the \\nincrease in government demand is not \\npaid for with increases in taxes or \\ndecreases in transfer payments. \\nSince higher government demand \\nraises aggregate demand, the AD function shifts up from AD(…,  G1, …) to  AD(…,  G2, …) (step 1). The \\nequilibrium GNP in turn rises to Y2(step 2). Thus the increase in government demand causes an increase \\nin real GNP. \\nThe adjustment process follows the “GNP too low” story. When government demand increases, but before \\nGNP rises to adjust, AD is greater than Y1. The excess demand for G&S depletes inventories, in this case \\nfor firms that supply the government, causing merchants to increase order size. This leads firms to \\nincrease output, thus raising GNP. \\nFigure 8.4 Effect of an Increase in Government Demand in \\nthe G&S Market \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn how a change in the U.S. dollar value affects equilibrium GNP. \\nSuppose the economy is initially in equilibrium in the G&S market with the exchange rate at \\nlevel E$/£1 and real GNP at Y1 as shown in . The initial AD function is written as AD(…,  E$/£1, …) to signify \\nthe level of the exchange rate and to denote that other variables affect AD and are at some initial and \\nunspecified values. \\nNext, suppose the U.S. dollar value rises, \\ncorresponding to a decrease in the \\nexchange rate from E$/£1 to E$/£2, ceteris \\nparibus. As explained in , , the increase in \\nthe spot dollar value also increases the real \\ndollar value, causing foreign G&S to \\nbecome relatively cheaper and U.S. G&S to \\nbecome more expensive. This change \\nreduces demand for U.S. exports and \\nincreases import demand, resulting in a \\nreduction in aggregate demand. The \\nceteris paribus assumption means that all \\nother exogenous variables are assumed to \\nremain fixed. \\nSince the higher dollar value lowers \\naggregate demand, the AD function shifts \\ndown from AD(…,  E$/£1, …) to  AD(…,  E$/£2, …) (step 1), and equilibrium GNP in turn falls to Y2 (step 2). \\nThus the increase in the U.S. dollar value causes a decrease in real GNP.  \\nThe adjustment process follows the “GNP too high” story. When the dollar value rises but before GNP falls \\nto adjust, Y1 > AD. The excess supply of G&S raises inventories, causing merchants to decrease order size. \\nThis leads firms to decrease output, lowering GNP. \\nKEY TAKEAWAY  \\nFigure 8.5 Effect of an Increase in the U.S. Dollar Value in \\nthe G&S Market \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn about the J-curve effect that explains how current account adjustment in response to a \\nchange in the currency value will vary over time. \\nIn the goods market model, it is assumed that the exchange rate (E$/£) is directly related to current \\naccount demand in the United States. The logic of the relationship goes as follows. If the dollar \\ndepreciates, meaning E$/£ rises, then foreign goods will become more expensive to U.S. residents, causing \\na decrease in import demand. At the same time U.S. goods will appear relatively cheaper to foreign \\nresidents, causing an increase in demand for U.S. exports. The increase in export demand and decrease in \\nimport demand both contribute to an increase in the current account demand. Since in the goods market \\nmodel, any increase in demand results in an increase in supply to satisfy that demand, the dollar \\ndepreciation should also lead to an increase in the actual current account balance.  \\nIn real-world economies, however, analysis of the data suggests that in many instances a depreciating \\ncurrency tends to cause, at least, a temporary increase in the deficit rather than the predicted decrease. \\nThe explanation for this temporary reversal of the cause-and-effect relationship is called the J-curve \\ntheory. In terms of future use of the AA-DD model, we will always assume the J-curve effect is not \\noperating, unless otherwise specified. One should think of this effect as a possible short -term exception to \\nthe standard theory. \\nThe theory of the J-curve is an explanation for the J-like temporal pattern of change in a country’s trade \\nbalance in response to a sudden or substantial depreciation (or devaluation) of the currency.  \\nConsider , depicting two variables measured, hypothetically, over some period: the U.S. dollar / British \\npound (E$/£) and the U.S. current account balance (CA = EX − IM). The exchange rate is meant to \\nrepresent the average value of the dollar against all other trading country currencies and would \\ncorrespond to a dollar value index that is often constructed and reported. Since the units of these two data \\nseries would be in very different scales, we imagine the exchange rate is measured along the left axis, \\nwhile the CA balance is measured in different units on the right-hand axis. With appropriately chosen \\nscales, we can line up the two series next to each other to see whether changes in the exchange rate seem \\nto correlate with positive or negative changes in the CA balance.

In this phase, a CA deficit \\nwould become larger, not smaller. \\nEventually, after period t2, the CA balance reverses direction and begins to increase — in other words, a \\ntrade deficit falls. The diagram demonstrates clearly how the CA balance follows the pattern of a “J” in the \\ntransition following a dollar depreciation, hence the name J-curve theory. \\nIn the real world, the period of time thought necessary for the CA balance to traverse the J pattern is \\nbetween one and two years. However, this estimate is merely a rough rule of thumb as the actual paths \\nwill be influenced by many other variable changes also occurring at the same time. Indeed, in some cases \\nthe J-curve effect may not even arise, so there is nothing automatic about it. \\nThe reasons for the J-curve effect can be better understood by decomposing the current account balance. \\nThe basic definition of the current account is the difference between the value of exports and the value of \\nimports. That is, \\nCA = EX − IM. \\nThe current account also includes income payments and receipts and unilateral transfers, but these \\ncategories are usually small and will not play a big role in this discussion — so we’ll ignore them.

The way these values are determined is by multiplying the quantity of imports by the price of \\neach imported item. We expand the CA definition by using the summation symbol and imag ining \\nsumming up across all exported goods and all imported goods: \\nCA = ΣPEXQEX − ΣPIMQIM. \\nHere ΣPEXQEX represents the summation of the price times quantities of all goods exported from the \\ncountry, while ΣPEXQEX is the summation of the price times quantities of all goods imported from the \\ncountry. \\nHowever, for imported goods we could also take note that foreign products are denominated in foreign \\ncurrency terms. To convert them to U.S. dollars we need to multiply by the current spot exchange rate. \\nThus we can expand the CA definition further by incorporating the exchange rate into the import term as \\nfollows: \\nCA = ΣPEXQEX − ΣE$/£P*IMQIM. \\nHere E$/£ represents whatever dollar/pound rate prevailed at the time of imports, and PIM* represents the \\nprice of each imported good denominated in foreign (*) pound currency terms. Thus the value of imports \\nis really the summation across all foreign imports of the exchange rate times the foreign price times \\nquantity. \\nThe J-curve theory recognizes that import and export quantities and prices are often arranged in advance \\nand set into a contract. For example, an importer of watches is likely to enter into a contract with the \\nforeign watch company to import a specific quantity over some future p eriod. The price of the watches will \\nalso be fixed by the terms of the contract. Such a contract provides assurances to the exporter that the \\nwatches he makes will be sold. It provides assurances to the importer that the price of the watches will \\nremain fixed. Contract lengths will vary from industry to industry and firm to firm, but may extend for as \\nlong as a year or more. \\nThe implication of contracts is that in the short run, perhaps over six to eighteen months, both the local \\nprices and quantities of imports and exports will remain fixed for many items. However, the contracts \\nmay stagger in time— that is, they may not all be negotiated and signed at the same date in the past. This \\nmeans that during any period some fraction of the contracts will expire and  be renegotiated.

Thus in the months following a dollar depreciation, contract renegotiations will \\ngradually occur, causing eventual, but slow, changes in the prices and quantities traded.  \\nWith these ideas in mind, consider a depreciation of the dollar. In the very short run — say, during the first \\nfew weeks— most of the contract terms will remain unchanged, meaning that the prices and quantities of \\nexports and imports will also stayed fixed. The only change affecting the CA formula, then, is the increase \\nin E$/*. Assuming all importers have not hedged their trades by entering to forward contracts, the increase \\ninE$/* will result in an immediate increase in the value of imports measured in dollar terms. Since the \\nprices and quantities do not change immediately, the CA balance falls. This is what can account for the \\ninitial stage of the J-curve effect, between periods t1and t2. \\nAs the dollar depreciation continues, and as contracts begin to be renegotiated, traders will adjust \\nquantities demanded. Since the dollar depreciation causes imported goods to become more expensive to \\nU.S. residents, the quantity of imported goods demanded and purchased will fall. Similarly, exported \\ngoods will appear cheaper to foreigners, and so as their contracts are renegotiated, they will begin to \\nincrease demand for U.S. exports. The changes in these quantities will both cause an increase in the \\ncurrent account (decrease in a trade deficit). Thus, as several months and years pass, the effects from the \\nchanges in quantities will surpass the price effect caused by the dollar depreciation and the CA balance \\nwill rise as shown in the diagram after time t2. \\nIt is worth noting that the standard theory, which says that a dollar depreciation causes an increase in the \\ncurrent account balance, assumes that the quantity effects— that is, the effects of the depreciation on \\nexport and import demand— are the dominant effects. The J-curve theory qualifies that effect by \\nsuggesting that although the quantity or demand effects will dominate, it may take several months or \\nyears before becoming apparent. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The J-curve theory represents a short-term exception to the standard assumption applied in the \\nG&S model in which a currency depreciation causes a decrease in the trade deficit. \\n• The theory of the J-curve is an explanation for the J-like temporal pattern of change in a \\ncountry’s trade balance in response to a sudden or substantial depreciation (or devaluation) of \\nthe currency.

Understand the basic structure and results of the AA-DD model of national output and exchange \\nrate determination. \\nThis chapter describes the derivation and the mechanics of the AA-DD model. The AA-DD model \\nrepresents a synthesis of the three previous market models: the foreign exchange (Forex) market, the \\nmoney market, and the goods and services market. In a sense, there is really very little new information \\npresented here. Instead, the chapter provides a graphical approach to integrate the results  from the three \\nmodels and to show their interconnectedness. However, because so much is going on simultaneously, \\nworking with the AA-DD model can be quite challenging. \\nThe AA-DD model is described with a diagram consisting of two curves (or lines): an \\nAA curve representing asset market equilibriums derived from the money market and foreign exchange \\nmarkets and a DD curve representing goods market (or demand) equilibriums. The intersection of the two \\ncurves identifies a market equilibrium in which each of the three markets is simultaneously in \\nequilibrium. Thus we refer to this equilibrium as a superequilibrium. \\nResults \\nThe main results of this section are descriptive and purely mechanical. The chapter describes the \\nderivation of the AA and DD curves, explains how changes in exogenous variables will cause shifts in the \\ncurves, and explains adjustment from one equilibrium to another. \\na. The DD curve is the set of exchange rate and GNP combinations that maintain equilibrium in the \\ngoods and services market, given fixed values for all other exogenous variables. \\nb. The DD curve shifts rightward whenever government demand (G), investment demand (I), transfer \\npayments (TR), or foreign prices (P£) increase or when taxes (T) or domestic prices (P$) decrease. \\nChanges in the opposite direction cause a leftward shift. \\nc. The AA curve is the set of exchange rate and GNP combinations that maintain equilibrium in the asset \\nmarkets, given fixed values for all other exogenous variables. \\nd. The AA curve shifts upward whenever money supply (MS), foreign interest rates (i£), or the expected \\nexchange rate (E$/£e) increase or when domestic prices (P$) decrease.

The intersection of the AA and DD curves depicts a superequilibrium in an economy since at that point \\nthe goods and services market, the domestic money market, and the foreign exchange market are all in \\nequilibrium simultaneously. \\nf. Changes in any exogenous variable that is not plotted on the axes (anything but  Y and E$/£) will cause a \\nshift of the AA or DD curves and move the economy out of equilibrium, temporarily. Adjustment to a new \\nequilibrium follows the principle that adjustment in the asset markets occurs much more rapidly than \\nadjustment in the goods and services market. Thus adjustment to the AA curve will always occur before \\nadjustment to the DD curve. \\nConnections \\nThe AA-DD model will allow us to understand how changes in macroeconomic policy — both monetary and \\nfiscal— can affect key aggregate economic variables when a country is open to international trade and \\nfinancial flows while accounting for the interaction of the variables among themselves. Specifically, the \\nmodel is used to identify potential effects of fiscal and monetary policy on exchange rates, trade balances , \\nGDP levels, interest rates, and price levels both domestically and abroad. In subsequent chapters, analyses \\nwill be done under both floating and fixed exchange rate regimes.  \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The AA-DD model integrates the workings of the money-Forex market and the G&S model into \\none supermodel. \\n• The AA curve is derived from the money-Forex model.

Learn how to derive the DD curve from the G&S model. \\nThe DD curve is derived by transferring information described in the goods and services (G&S) market \\nmodel onto a new diagram to show the relationship between the exchange rate and equilibrium gross \\nnational product (GNP). The original G&S market, depicted in the top part of  , plots the aggregate \\ndemand (AD) function with respect to changes in U.S. GNP (Y$). Aggregate demand is measured along the \\nvertical axis and aggregate supply (or the GNP) is measured on the horizontal axis. As discussed in  , , the \\nAD function is dependent upon several different exogenous variables, most notably the exchange rate \\nbetween domestic and foreign currency (E$/£). However, AD is also affected by investment demand (I), \\ngovernment demand (G), government tax revenues (T), government transfer payments (TR), and the \\nprice level in the domestic (P$) and foreign (P£) countries. The endogenous variable in the model is U.S. \\nGNP (Y$). (See for a quick reference.) In this exercise, since our focus is on the exchange rate, we label the \\nAD function in as AD(E$/£, …), where the ellipsis (…) is meant to indicate there are other unspecified \\nvariables that also influence AD. \\nTable 9.1 G&S Market \\nExogenous Variables E$/£, I, G, T, TR, P$, P£ \\nEndogenous Variable Y$ \\nInitially, let’s assume the exchange rate is at a value in the market given by E$/*1. We need to remember that all the \\nother variables that affect AD are also at some initial level. Written explicitly, we could write AD \\nas AD(E$/£1, I1, G1, T1, TR1, P$1, P£1). The AD function with exchange rate E$/£1 intersects the forty-five-degree line at \\npoint Gwhich determines the equilibrium level of GNP given by Y$1.

The ceteris \\nparibus assumption means that investment, \\ngovernment, taxes, and so on stay fixed at \\nlevelsI1, G1, T1, and so on. Since a dollar depreciation \\nmakes foreign G&S relatively more expensive and \\ndomestic goods relatively cheaper, AD shifts up \\nto AD(E$/£2, …).

In this case, equilibrium is not represented by \\na single point. Instead every point along the DD curve is an equilibrium value.  \\nIf the economy were at a point above the DD curve, say, at I in the lower diagram, the exchange rate would \\nbe E$/£2 and the GNP level at Y$1.

This continues until AD = Y at point H. For all points \\nto the left of the DD curve, AD > Y, therefore the behavior of producers would cause a shift to the right \\nfrom any point like I to a point like H on the DD curve. \\nSimilarly, at a point such as J, to the right of the DD curve, the exchange rate is E$/£1and the GNP level is \\nat Y$2. This corresponds to point J in the upper diagram above where aggregate demand is less than supply \\n(AD < Y). In the G&S model, whenever \\nsupply exceeds demand, producers respond \\nby reducing supply, thus GNP falls. This \\ncontinues until AD = Y at point G. For all \\npoints to the right of the DD curve, AD < Y, \\ntherefore the behavior of producers would \\ncause a shift to the left from any point \\nlike Jto a point like G on the DD curve. \\nA useful analogy is to think of the DD curve \\nas a river flowing through a valley. (See the \\n3-D diagram in .) The hills rise up to the \\nright and left along the upward-sloping DD \\ncurve.

Learn which exogenous variables will shift the DD curve and in which direction. \\nThe DD curve depicts the relationship between changes in one exogenous variable and one endogenous \\nvariable within the goods and services (G&S) market model. The exogenous variable assumed to change is \\nthe exchange rate. The endogenous variable affected is the gross national p roduct (GNP). At all points \\nalong the DD curve, it is assumed that all other exogenous variables remain fixed at their original values.  \\nThe DD curve will shift, however, if there is a change in any of the other exogenous variables. We illustrate \\nhow this works in Figure 9.3 \"DD Curve Effects from a Decrease in Investment Demand\". Here, we \\nassume that the level of investment demand in the economy falls from its initial level  I1 to a lower level I2. \\nAt the initial investment level (I1) and initial exchange rate (E$/£1) the AD curve is given by AD(…,  E$/£1, I1, \\n…). The AD curve intersects the \\nforty-five-degree line at point G, \\nwhich is transferred to \\npoint G on the DD curve below. \\nIf the investment level and all \\nother exogenous variables \\nremain fixed while the exchange \\nrate increases to E$/£2, then the \\nAD curve shifts up \\nto AD(…,  E$/£2, I1, …), \\ngenerating the equilibrium \\npoints H in both diagrams. This \\nexercise plots out the initial DD \\ncurve labeled DD|I1 in the lower \\ndiagram connecting \\npoints G and H.

The reduction in I leads to a reduction in AD, ceteris paribus. At the exchange \\nrate E$/£1, the AD curve will shift down to AD(…,  E$/£1, I2, …), intersecting the forty -five-degree line at \\npoint K. Point K above, which corresponds to the combination (E$/£1, I2), is transferred to point K on the \\nlower diagram. This point lies on a new DD curve because a second exogenous variable, namely  I, has \\nchanged. If we maintain the investment level at I2 and change the exchange rate up to E$/£2, the \\nequilibrium will shift to point L (shown only on the lower diagram), plotting out a whole new DD curve. \\nThis DD curve is labeled D′D′|I2, which means “the DD curve given is I = I2.” \\nThe effect of a decrease in investment demand is to lower aggregate demand and shift the DD curve to the \\nleft. Indeed, a change in any exogenous variable that reduces aggregate demand, except the exchange rate, \\nwill cause the DD curve to shift to the left.

We need to remember that all the other \\nexogenous variables that affect the asset market are also at some initial level such as i £1, E$/£e1, M$ S1, \\nand P$1. The real money demand function with GNP level Y$1 intersects with real money supply at \\npoint G1 in the money market diagram determining the interest rate i$1. The interest rate in turn \\ndetermines RoR$1, which intersects with RoR£ at point G2, determining the equilibrium exchange rate \\nE$/£1. These two values are transferred to the lowest diagram at point G , establishing one point on the AA \\ncurve (Y$1, E$/£1). \\nNext, suppose GNP rises, for some unstated reason, from Y$1 to Y$, ceteris paribus.

Learn which exogenous variables will shift the AA curve and in which direction. \\nThe AA curve depicts the relationship between \\nchanges in one exogenous variable and one \\nendogenous variable within the asset market model. \\nThe exogenous variable changed is gross national \\nproduct (GNP). The endogenous variable affected is \\nthe exchange rate. At all points along the AA curve, it \\nis assumed that all other exogenous variables remain \\nfixed at their original values. \\nThe AA curve will shift if there is a change in any of \\nthe other exogenous variables. We illustrate how this \\nworks in , where we assume that the money supply \\nin the economy falls from its initial level MS1 to a \\nlower level MS2. \\nAt the initial money supply (MS1) and initial GNP \\nlevel Y$1, real money demand intersects real money \\nsupply at point G, determining the interest rate i$1. \\nThis in turn determines the rate of return on U.S. \\nassets, RoR$1, which intersects the foreign \\nBritish RoR£ at G in the upper diagram, determining \\nthe equilibrium exchange rate E$/£1.

Note, AA|MS1 is read as “the AA curve given that MS = MS1.” \\nNow, suppose the money supply MS falls to MS2. The reduction in MS leads to a reduction in the real \\nmoney supply, which, at GNP level Y$1, shifts the money market equilibrium to point I, determining a new \\ninterest rate, i$3. In the Forex market, the rate of return rises to RoR$3, which determines the equilibrium \\nexchange rate E$/£3. The equilibriums at points I corresponding to the combination (Y$1, E$/£3) are \\ntransferred to point I on the lower diagram. This point lies on a new AA curve because a second exogenous \\nvariable, namely, MS, has changed. If we maintain the money supply at MS2 and change the GNP up \\nto Y$2, the equilibrium will shift to point J(shown only on the lower diagram), plotting out a whole new AA \\ncurve. This AA curve is labeled A′A′|MS2, which means “the AA curve given that MS = MS2.” \\nThe effect of a decrease in the money supply is to shift the AA curve downward. Indeed, a change in any \\nexogenous variable in the asset markets that reduces the equilibrium exchange rate, except a change in \\nGNP, will cause the AA curve to shift down. Likewise, any change in an exogenous variable that causes an \\nincrease in the exchange rate will cause the AA curve to shift up.

Apply the AA curve and the DD curve to define a superequilibrium. \\nThe DD curve represents the set of equilibriums in the goods and services (G&S) market. It describes an \\nequilibrium gross national product (GNP) level for each and every exchange rate that may prevail. Due to \\nthe assumption that firms respond to excess demand by increasing supply (and to excess supply by \\ndecreasing supply), GNP rises or falls until the economy is in equilibrium on the DD curve.  \\nThe AA curve represents the set of equilibriums in the asset market. It indicates an equilibrium exchange \\nrate for each and every GNP level that might prevail. Due to the assumption that investors will demand \\nforeign currency when the foreign rate of return exceeds the domestic return and that they will supply \\nforeign currency when the domestic rate of return exceeds the foreign return, the exchange rate will rise \\nor fall until the economy is in equilibrium on the AA curve. \\nSince both the G&S market and the asset \\nmarkets are operating concurrently, \\nequilibriums in both markets can only occur \\nwhere the DD curve intersects the AA curve. This \\nis shown in Figure 9.7 \"AA-DD \\nSuperequilibrium\" at point F, with equilibrium \\nGNP (_$) and exchange rate (Ê$/£). It is worth \\nemphasizing that at pointF, the three markets—\\nthat is, the G&S market, the money market, and \\nthe foreign exchange market— are in equilibrium \\nsimultaneously. For this reason, point F is \\nmore than a plain old equilibrium; instead it \\nis a superequilibrium. \\nThe superequilibrium point is where we \\nwould expect behavioral responses by firms, \\nFigure 9.8 A 3-D AA-DD Depiction \\n \\nFigure 9.7 AA-DD Superequilibrium \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn how to describe the complete adjustment to equilibrium in the AA-DD model. \\nIn order to discuss adjustment to the superequilibrium, we must first talk about how an economy can end \\nup out of equilibrium. This will occur anytime there is a change in one or more of the exogenous variables \\nthat cause the AA or DD curves to shift. In a real economy, we should expect these variables to be \\nchanging frequently. Variables such as interest rates will certainly change every day . A variable such as the \\naverage expected future exchange rate held by investors probably changes every minute. Each time an \\nexogenous variable changes, the superequilibrium point will shift, setting off behavioral responses by \\nhouseholds, businesses, and investors that will affect the exchange rate and gross national product (GNP) \\nin the direction of the new superequilibrium. However, as we will indicate below, the adjustment process \\nwill take time, perhaps several months or more, depending on the size of the change. Since we should \\nexpect that as adjustment to one variable change is in process, other exogenous variables will also change, \\nwe must recognize that the superequilibrium is really like a moving target. Each day, maybe each hour, \\nthe target moves, resulting in a continual adjustment process. \\nAlthough an equilibrium may never be reached in the real-world economy, the model remains very useful \\nin understanding how changes in some variables will affect the behavior of agents and influence other \\nvariables. The model in essence offers us the opportunity to conduct experiments in simplified settings. \\nChanging one exogenous variable and inferring its effect is a comparative statics  experiment because of \\nthe ceteris paribus assumption. Ceteris paribus allows us to isolate one change and work through its \\nimpact with certainty that nothing else could influence the result.  \\nBelow, we’ll consider adjustment to two changes: a reduction in investment demand, which shifts the DD \\ncurve, and an increase in foreign interest rates, which shifts the AA curve.  \\nReduction in Investment \\nConsider adjustment to a decrease in investment demand. Begin with an original superequilibrium, where \\nDD crosses AA at point F with GNP at Y$1 and exchange rate at E$/£1.

The increase in \\nthe exchange rate represents a \\ndepreciation of the U.S. dollar value. \\nHowever, this result does not explain the \\nadjustment process, so let’s take a more \\ncareful look at how the economy gets from \\npoint F to G. \\nStep 1: When investment demand falls, \\naggregate demand falls short of aggregate \\nsupply, leading to a buildup of inventories. \\nFirms respond by cutting back supply, and \\nGNP slowly begins to fall. Initially, there is \\nno change in the exchange rate. On the \\ngraph, this is represented by a leftward shift from the initial equilibrium at point  F (Y$1to Y$2). Adjustment \\nto changes in aggregate demand will be gradual, perhaps taking several months or more to be fully \\nimplemented. \\nStep 2: As GNP falls, it causes a decrease in U.S. interest rates. With lower interest rates, the rate of \\nreturn on U.S. assets falls below that in the United Kingdom and international investors shift funds \\nabroad, leading to a dollar depreciation (pound appreciation)— that is, an increase in the exchange \\nrate E$/£. This moves the economy upward, back to the AA curve. The adjustment in the asset market will \\noccur quickly after the change in interest rates, so the leftward shift from point  F in the diagram results in \\nadjustment upward to regain equilibrium in the asset market on the AA curve.  \\nStep 3: Continuing reductions in GNP caused by excess aggregate demand, results in continuing \\ndecreases in interest rates and rates of return, repeating the stepwise proc ess above until the new \\nequilibrium is reached at point G in the diagram. \\nDuring the adjustment process, there are several other noteworthy changes taking place.

Adjustment in the goods market will be trying to reachieve equilibrium by getting back to the \\nDD curve. However, the economy will never get to Y$A. That’s because the asset market will adjust in the \\nmeantime. As GNP falls, the exchange rate is pushed up to get back onto the AA curve. Remember, that \\nasset market adjustment takes place quickly after an interest rate change (perhaps in several hours or \\ndays), while goods market adjustment can take months. When the exchang e rate rises, the dollar \\ndepreciation makes foreign goods more expensive and reduces imports. It also makes U.S. goods cheaper \\nto foreigners and stimulates exports, both of which cause an increase in current account demand. This \\nchange in demand is represented as a movement along the new D′D′ curve. Thus when the exchange rate \\nrises up to E$/£2 during the adjustment process, aggregate demand will have risen from Y $A to Y$B along the \\nnew D′D′ curve. In other words, the “target” for GNP adjustment moves closer as the exchange rate rises. \\nIn the end, the target for GNP reaches Y$3 just as the exchange rate rises to E$/£3. \\nIncrease in Foreign Interest Rates \\nConsider adjustment to an increase in the foreign interest rate, i£. Begin with an original superequilibrium \\nwhere DD crosses AA at point F with GNP at Y1 and exchange rate at E$/£1.

This causes an immediate increase \\nin the demand for foreign British currency, causing an appreciation of the pound and a depreciation of the \\nU.S. dollar. Thus the exchange rate (E$/£) rises. This change is represented by the movement from \\npoint Fto G on the AA-DD diagram. The AA curve shifts up to reflect the new set of asset market \\nequilibriums corresponding to the now-higher foreign interest rate. Since the foreign exchange market \\nadjusts very swiftly to changes in interest rates, the economy will not remain off the new A ′A′ curve for \\nvery long. \\nStep 2: Now that the exchange rate has risen to E$/£2, the real exchange has also increased. This implies \\nforeign goods and services are relatively more expensive while U.S. G&S are relatively cheaper. This will \\nraise demand for U.S. exports, curtail demand for U.S. imports, and result in an increase in current \\naccount and thereby aggregate demand. Note that the new equilibrium demand at exchange rate is \\ntemporarily at GNP level Y4, which is on the DD curve given the exchange rate E$/£2. Because aggregate \\ndemand exceeds aggregate supply, inventories will begin to fall, stimulating an increase in production and \\nthus GNP. This is represented by a rightward shift from point G (small arrow). \\nStep 3: As GNP rises, so does real money demand, causing an increase in U.S. interest rates. With higher \\ninterest rates, the rate of return on U.S. assets rises above that in the United Kingdom and international \\ninvestors shift funds back to the United States, leading to a dollar appreciation (pound depreciation), or \\nthe decrease in the exchange rate (E$/£). This moves the economy downward, back to the A′A′ curve. The \\nadjustment in the asset market will occur quickly after the change in interest rates. Thus the rightward \\nshift from point G in the diagram results in quick downward adjustment to regain equilibrium in the asset \\nmarket on the A′A′ curve, as shown. \\nStep 4: Continuing increases in GNP caused by excess aggregate demand, results in continuing increases \\nin U.S. interest rates and rates of return, repeating the stepwise process above until the new equilibrium is \\nreached at point H in the diagram. \\nDuring the adjustment process, there are several other noteworthy changes taking place. At point G , \\naggregate demand exceeds supply by the difference Y4 − Y1. Adjustment in the goods market will be trying \\nto reachieve equilibrium by getting back to the DD curve.

As GNP rises, the exchange rate is \\ngradually pushed down to get back onto the A′A′ curve. When the exchange rate falls, the dollar \\nappreciation makes foreign goods cheaper, raising imports. It also makes U.S. goods more expensive to \\nforeigners, reducing exports— both of which cause a decrease in current account demand.

Derive a graphical mechanism in the AA-DD model to represent the effects of changes in the \\nsuperequilibrium on the current account balance. \\nIn later chapters we will use the AA-DD model to describe the effects of policy changes on macroeconomic \\nvariables in an open economy. The two most important macro variables are the exchange r ate and the \\ncurrent account (trade) balance. The effects of changes on the exchange rate are vividly portrayed in the \\nAA-DD diagram since this variable is plotted along the vertical axis and its value is determined as an \\nelement of the equilibrium. The current account (CA) variable is not displayed in the AA-DD diagram, but \\nwith some further thought we can devise a method to identify the current account balance at different \\npositions in the AA-DD diagram. \\nFirst, note that there is no “equilibrium” current account balance in a floating exchange rate system. Any \\nbalance on the current account is possible because any balance can correspond to balance on the balance \\nof payments. The balance of payments is made up of two broad subaccounts: the current account and the \\nfinancial account, the sum of whose balances must equal zero. When the balances sum to zero, the foreign \\ndemand for domestic goods, services, income, and assets is equal to domestic supply of goods, services, \\nincome, and assets. Thus there must always be “balance” on the balance of payments regardless of the \\nbalances on the individual subaccounts. \\nIso-CAB Line \\nAn iso-CAB line is a line drawn on an AA- DD \\ndiagram, , representing a set of points along \\nwhich the current account balance (CAB) is the \\nsame. Note that “iso” is a prefix that \\nmeans the same. In the adjoining diagram, we \\nhave superimposed three-dotted iso-CAB \\nlines labeled CC, C′C′, and C″C″. Each line \\nrepresents a set of GNP and exchange rate \\ncombinations that generate the same \\nbalance on the current account.

Thus the CAB balance on  C″C″ is greater than \\nthe balance along CC. Also note that each CAB line is positively sloped with a slope less than the slope of \\nthe DD curve. Next, we’ll continue with a justification for this description. \\nJustifying the Shape of the Iso-CAB Line \\nConsider the superequilibrium point at the intersection of AA and DD. The positions of these two cu rves \\nare determined by the values of the exogenous variables in the model, including the domestic price level \\n(P$), the foreign price level (P£), tax revenues (T), and transfer payments (TR), among others. The \\nintersection of the two curves determines the equilibrium GNP level ( Y$) and the exchange rate (E$/£) (not \\nlabeled in diagram). Recall from, that the DD curve is derived from the aggregate demand function, one \\ncomponent of which is the current account function. The current account function, as shown b elow, is a \\nfunction of all the variables listed immediately above: \\n \\nThus at the intersection of AA and DD there are presumed known values for the exogenous variables and \\ndetermined values for the endogenous variables, E$/£ and Y$. \\nAll these values could, in principle, be plugged into the current account demand function ( CAD) to \\ndetermine the CA balance at the equilibrium. Let’s assume that value is given by K, as shown in the above \\nexpression. \\nNow let’s consider movements in the superequilibrium to other points on the diagram. Let’s suppose that \\nthe equilibrium moved to point x directly to the right. That could arise from a rightward shift of DD and \\nan upward shift of AA. We will also assume that this shift did not arise due to changes in  P$, P£, T, or TR, \\nthe other exogenous variables that affect the current account. (More on this issue below.) One possibility \\nis an increase in the money supply and an increase in investment demand. Note that these shifts are not \\ndepicted. \\nAt point x, GNP is higher while the exchange rate and the other exogenous variables are the same as \\nbefore. Since an increase in Y$ raises disposable income, which reduces current account demand, the \\ncurrent account balance must be at a lower level at point x compared to the initial equilibrium. \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Since a decrease in Y$lowers disposable income, which raises \\ncurrent account demand, the current account balance must be at a higher level at point  z compared to the \\ninitial equilibrium. \\nNext, suppose the equilibrium had shifted to point y instead. In this case, the exchange rate (E$/£) is lower \\nwhile GNP and the other exogenous variables are the same as before. Since a decrease in E$/£ reduces the \\nreal exchange rate, which reduces current account demand, the current account balance must be at a \\nlower level at point ycompared to the initial equilibrium. \\nFinally, suppose the equilibrium had shifted to point w. In this case, the exchange rate, E$/£, is higher \\nwhile GNP and the other exogenous variables are the same as before. Since an increase in  E$/£ raises the \\nreal exchange rate, which increases current account demand, the current account balance must be at a \\nhigher level at pointy compared to the initial equilibrium. \\nSince a movement to w and z results in an increase in the current account balance, while a shift \\nto x or y causes a reduction in the balance, the line representing a constant CAB must be positively sloped.  \\nAnother way to see this is to use the CAD function above. Suppose the CAB is originally at the value K. If \\nthe exchange rate (E$/£) rises, ceteris paribus, then CA will rise. We can now ask how GNP would have to \\nchange to get back to a CA balance of K. Clearly, if Y rises, disposable income rises and the current \\naccount balance falls. Raise GNP by precisely the right amount, and we can get the CAB back to  K. Thus \\nan increase in E$/£ must accompany an increase in GNP to maintain a fixed current account balance and \\ntherefore an iso-CAB line must be positively sloped. \\nThe last thing we need to show is that the iso-CAB line is less steeply sloped than the DD line. Suppose the \\neconomy moved to a point such as v, which is on the same DD curve as the original superequilibrium. \\nRecall from , , the DD curve is derived from a change in the exchange rate and its effect on equilibrium \\nGNP in the G&S market alone. The increase in the exchange rate causes an increase in current account \\ndemand through its effect on the real exchange rate. This causes an increase in aggregate demand, which \\ninspires the increase in GNP.

Since GNP is higher at v, consumption demand (CD) must also be higher. However, because the \\nmarginal propensity to consume is less than one, not all the extra GNP will be spent on consumption \\ngoods; some will be saved. Nevertheless, aggregate demand (on the right side) must rise up to match the \\nincrease in supply on the left side. Since all the increase in demand cannot come from con sumption, the \\nremainder must come from the current account. This implies that a movement along the DD curve \\nto v results in an increase in the current account balance. It also implies that the iso -CAB line must be less \\nsteeply sloped than the DD curve. \\nUsing the Iso-CAB Line \\nThe iso-CAB line can be used to assess the change in the country’s current account balance from any \\nexogenous variable change except changes in P$, P£, T, and TR. The reason we must exclude these \\nvariables is because the current account demand function is also dependent on these exogenous variables. \\nIf tax revenues increased, for example, all the iso-CAB lines would shift, making it much more difficult to \\npinpoint the final effect on the current account balance. \\nHowever, for monetary policy changes and government spending fiscal policy changes, the iso -CAB line \\nwill work. Anytime the superequilibrium shifts above the original iso -CAB line, the economy will move \\nonto another iso-CAB line with a higher balance. (This is like the shift to point v in .) Recall that \\nthe CA = EX − IM, which can be positive or negative. If CAB were in surplus originally, an increase in the \\nCAB (as with a movement to v) would imply an increase in the CA surplus. However, if the CAB were in \\ndeficit originally, then an increase in CAB implies a reduction in the deficit. If the increase in the CAB \\nwere sufficiently large, the CAB could move from deficit to surplus.  \\nIn a similar way, anytime the superequilibrium shifts below an initial iso-CAB line, the CAB surplus will \\nfall, or the CAB deficit will rise. \\nRemember that the iso-CAB line is only used a reference to track the current account balance.

In this chapter, that analysis is expanded to an open economy (i.e., \\none open to trade) and to the effects on exchange rates and curren t account balances. \\nResults \\nUsing the AA-DD model, several important relationships between key economic variables are shown:  \\n• Expansionary monetary policy (↑MS) causes an increase in GNP and a depreciation of the domestic \\ncurrency in a floating exchange rate system in the short run. \\n• Contractionary monetary policy (↓MS) causes a decrease in GNP and an appreciation of the domestic \\ncurrency in a floating exchange rate system in the short run. \\n• Expansionary fiscal policy (↑G, ↑TR, or ↓T) causes an increase in GNP and an appreciation of the domestic \\ncurrency in a floating exchange rate system. \\n• Contractionary fiscal policy (↓G, ↓TR, or ↑T) causes a decrease in GNP and a depreciation of the domestic \\ncurrency in a floating exchange rate system. \\n• In the long run, once inflation effects are included, expansionary monetary policy ( ↑MS) in a full \\nemployment economy causes no long-term change in GNP and a depreciation of the domestic currency in \\na floating exchange rate system. In the transition, the exchange rate overshoots its long-run target and \\nGNP rises then falls. \\n• A sterilized foreign exchange intervention will have no effect on GNP or the exchange rate in the AA-DD \\nmodel, unless international investors adjust their expected future exchange ra te in response. \\n• A central bank can influence the exchange rate with direct Forex interventions (buying or selling domestic \\ncurrency in exchange for foreign currency). To sell foreign currency and buy domestic currency, the \\ncentral bank must have a stockpile of foreign currency reserves.

Since some of these macroeconomic variables are controlled by the government, we can \\nuse the model to understand the likely effects of government policy changes. The two main levers the \\ngovernment controls are monetary policy (changes in the money supply) and fiscal policy (changes in the \\ngovernment budget). In this chapter, the AA-DD model is applied to understand government policy \\neffects in the context of a floating exchange rate system. In , we’ll revisit these same government policies \\nin the context of a fixed exchange rate system. \\nIt is important to recognize that these results are what “would” happen under the full set of assumptions \\nthat describe the AA-DD model. These effects may or may not happen in reality. Despite this problem, the \\nmodel surely captures some of the simple cause-and-effect relationships and therefore helps us to \\nunderstand the broader implications of policy changes. Thus even if in reality many more elements not \\ndescribed in the model may act to influence the key endogenous variables, the AA -DD model at least gives \\na more complete picture of some of the expected tendencies. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The main objective of the AA-DD model is to assess the effects of monetary and fiscal policy \\nchanges. \\n• It is important to recognize that these results are what “would” happen under the full set of \\nassumptions that describes the AA-DD model; they may or may not accurately describe actual \\noutcomes in actual economies. \\nEXERCISE  \\n1.

This is depicted in the diagram as a \\nshift from the red AA to the blue A′A′ line. \\nThere are several different levels of detail that can be provided to describe the effects of this policy. Below, \\nwe present three descriptions with increasing degrees of completeness. First the quick result, then the \\nquick result with the transition process described, and finally the complete adjustment story.  \\nQuick Result \\nThe increase in AA causes a shift in the superequilibrium point from F to H. In adjusting to the new \\nequilibrium at H, GNP rises from Y1 to Y2 and the exchange rate increases from E$/£1 to E$/£2. The increase \\nin the exchange rate represents an increase in the British pound value and a decrease in the U.S. dollar \\nvalue. In other words, it is an appreciation of the pound and a depreciation of the dollar. Since the final \\nequilibrium point H is above the initial iso-CAB line CC, the current account balance increases. \\n(See Chapter 9 \"The AA-DD Model\", Section 9.8 \"AA-DD and the Current Account Balance\" for a \\ndescription of CC.) If the CAB were in surplus at F, then the surplus increases; if the CAB were in deficit, \\nthen the deficit falls. Thus U.S. expansionary monetary policy causes an increase in GNP, a depreciation of \\nthe U.S. dollar, and an increase in the current account balance in a floating exchange rate system \\naccording to the AA-DD model. \\nTransition Description \\nConsider the upward shift of the AA curve due to the increase in the money supply. Since exchange rates \\nadjust much more rapidly than GNP, the economy will initially adjust back to the new A′ A′ curve before \\nany change in GNP occurs. That means the first adjustment will be from point  F to point G directly above. \\nThe exchange rate will increase from E$/£1 to E$/£1′, representing a depreciation of the U.S. dollar. \\nNow at point G, the economy lies to the left of the DD curve. Thus GNP will begin to rise to get back to \\ngoods and services (G&S) market equilibrium on the DD curve. However, as GNP rises, the economy \\nmoves to the right above the A′A′ curve, which forces a downward readjustment of the exchange rate to get \\nback to A′A′. In the end, the economy will adjust in a stepwise fashion from point  G to point H, with each \\nrightward movement in GNP followed by a quick reduction in the exchange rate to remain on the A ′A′ \\ncurve. This process will continue until the economy reaches the superequilibrium at point H.

Above the rate it will ultimately \\nreach E$/£2 before settling back to superequilibrium value. This is an example of exchange rate \\novershooting. In the transition, the exchange rateovershoots its ultimate long-run value. \\nExchange rate overshooting is used as one explanation for the volatility of exchange rates in floating \\nmarkets. If many small changes occur frequently in an economy, the economy may always be in transition \\nmoving to a superequilibrium. Because of the more rapid adjustment of exchange rates, it is possible that \\nmany episodes of overshooting— both upward and downward— can occur in a relatively short period. \\nComplete Adjustment Story \\nStep 1: When the money supply increases, real money supply will exceed real money demand in the \\neconomy. Since households and businesses hold more money than they would like, at current interest \\nrates, they begin to convert liquid money assets into less-liquid nonmoney assets. This raises the supply of \\nlong-term deposits and the amount of funds available for banks to loan. More money to lend will lower \\naverage U.S. interest rates, which in turn will result in a lower U.S. rate of return in t he Forex market. \\nSince RoR$ < ROR£ now, there will be an immediate increase in the demand for foreign British currency, \\nthus causing an appreciation of the pound and a depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Thus the exchange rate \\n(E$/£) rises. This change is represented by the movement from point F to G on the AA-DD diagram. The AA \\ncurve has shifted up to reflect the new set of asset market equilbria corresponding to the higher U.S. \\nmoney supply. Since the money market and foreign exchange (Forex) markets adju st very swiftly to the \\nmoney supply change, the economy will not remain off the new A′A′ curve for very long. \\nStep 2: Now that the exchange rate has risen to E$/£1′, the real exchange has also increased. This implies \\nforeign goods and services are relatively more expensive while U.S. G&S are relatively cheaper. This will \\nraise demand for U.S. exports, curtail demand for U.S. imports, and result in an increase in current \\naccount and, thereby, aggregate demand. Because aggregate demand exceeds aggregate suppl y, \\ninventories will begin to fall, stimulating an increase in production and thus GNP. This is represented by a \\nrightward shift from point G. \\nStep 3: As GNP rises, so does real money demand, causing an increase in U.S. interest rates. With higher \\ninterest rates, the rate of return on U.S. assets rises above that in the United Kingdom, and international \\ninvestors shift funds back to the United States, resulting in a dollar appreciation (pound depreciation) —\\nthat is, a decrease in the exchange rate (E$/£).

Thus the \\nrightward shift from point G in the diagram results in quick downward adjustment to regain equilibrium \\nin the asset market on the A′A′ curve, as shown in the figure. \\nStep 4: Continuing increases in GNP caused by excess aggregate demand, results in continuing increases \\nin U.S. interest rates and rates of return, repeating the stepwise process above until the new equilibrium is \\nreached at point H in the diagram. \\nStep 5: The equilibrium at H lies to the northeast of F along the original DD curve.

Learn how changes in fiscal policy affect GNP, the value of the exchange rate, and the current \\naccount balance in a floating exchange rate system in the context of the AA-DD model. \\n2. Understand the adjustment process in the money market, the Forex market, and the G&S \\nmarket. \\nIn this section, we use the AA-DD model to assess the effects of fiscal policy in a floating exchange rate \\nsystem. Recall that fiscal policy refers to any change in expenditures or revenues within any branch of the \\ngovernment. This means any change in government spending— transfer payments, or taxes, by either \\nfederal, state, or local governments— represents a fiscal policy change. Since changes in expenditures or \\nrevenues will often affect a government budget balance, we can also say that a change in the government \\nsurplus or deficit represents a change in fiscal policy. \\nWhen government spending or transfer payments increase, or tax revenues decrease, we refer to it as \\nexpansionary fiscal policy. These actions would also be associated with an increase in the government \\nbudget deficit or a decrease in its budget \\nsurplus. If the government acts to reduce \\ngovernment spending or transfer \\npayments, or increase tax revenues, it is \\nreferred to as contractionary fiscal policy. \\nThese actions would also be \\nassociated with a decrease in the \\ngovernment budget deficit, or an \\nincrease in its budget surplus. \\nExpansionary Fiscal Policy \\nSuppose the economy is originally at a \\nsuperequilibrium shown as \\npoint J in Figure 10.2 \"Expansionary Fiscal \\nPolicy in the AA-DD Model with \\nFloating Exchange Rates\".

Next, suppose the government \\ndecides to increase government spending (or increase transfer payments or decrease taxes). As shown \\nin Chapter 9 \"The AA-DD Model\",Section 9.3 \"Shifting the DD Curve\", fiscal policy changes cause a shift \\nin the DD curve. More specifically, an increase in government spending (or an increase in transfer \\npayments or a decrease in taxes) will cause DD to shift rightward (i.e., ↑G, ↑TR, and ↓T all are DD right-\\nshifters). This is depicted in the diagram as a shift from the red DD to the blue D′D′ line. \\nThere are several different levels of detail that can be provided to describe the effects of this policy. Below,  \\nwe present three descriptions with increasing degrees of completeness: first the quick result, then the \\nquick result with the transition process described, and finally the complete adjustment story.  \\nQuick Result \\nThe increase in DD causes a shift in the superequilibrium point from J to K. In adjusting to the new \\nequilibrium at K, GNP rises from Y1 to Y2 and the exchange rate decreases from E$/£1 to E$/£2. The decrease \\nin the exchange represents a decrease in the British pound value and an increase in the U. S. dollar value. \\nIn other words, it is a depreciation of the pound and an appreciation of the dollar. Since the final \\nequilibrium point K is below the initial iso-CAB line CC, the current account balance decreases. (Caveat: \\nthis will be true for all fiscal expansions, but the iso-CAB line can only be used with an increase in G; \\nsee Chapter 9 \"The AA-DD Model\", Section 9.8 \"AA-DD and the Current Account Balance\" for an \\nexplanation.) If the CAB were in surplus at J, then the surplus decreases; if the CAB were in deficit, then \\nthe deficit rises. Thus the U.S. expansionary fiscal policy causes an increase in the U.S. GNP, an \\nappreciation of the U.S. dollar, and a decrease in the current account balance in a floating exchange rate \\nsystem according to the AA-DD model. \\nTransition Description \\nIf the expansionary fiscal policy occurs because of an increase in government spending, then government \\ndemand for goods and services (G&S) will increase.

In the end, the economy will adjust in a stepwise fashion \\nfrom point Jto point K, with each rightward movement in GNP followed by a quick reductio n in the \\nexchange rate to remain on the AA curve. This process will continue until the economy reaches the \\nsuperequilibrium at point K. \\nComplete Adjustment Story \\nStep 1: If the expansionary fiscal policy occurs because of an increase in government spending , then \\ngovernment demand for G&S will increase. If the expansionary fiscal policy occurs due to an increase in \\ntransfer payments or a decrease in taxes, then disposable income will increase, leading to an increase in \\nconsumption demand. In either case aggregate demand increases. Before any adjustment occurs, the \\nincrease in aggregate demand implies aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, which will lead to a \\ndecline in inventories. To prevent this decline, retailers (or government suppliers) will signal firms to \\nproduce more. As supply increases so does the GNP, and the economy moves to the right of point J.  \\nStep 2: As GNP rises, so does real money demand, causing an increase in U.S. interest rates. With higher \\ninterest rates, the rate of return on U.S. assets rises above that in the United Kingdom and international \\ninvestors shift funds back to the United States, resulting in a dollar appreciation (pound depreciation) —\\nthat is, a decrease in the exchange rate E$/£. This moves the economy downward, back to the AA curve. The \\nadjustment in the asset market will occur quickly after the change in interest rates. Thus the rightward \\nshift from point J in the diagram results in quick downward adjustment to regain equilibrium in the asset \\nmarket on the AA curve, as shown. \\nStep 3: Continuing increases in GNP caused by excess aggregate demand, results in continuing increases \\nin U.S. interest rates and rates of return, repeating the stepwise process above until the new equilibrium is \\nreached at point K in the diagram. \\nStep 4: The equilibrium at K lies to the southeast of J along the original AA curve. As shown in Chapter 9 \\n\"The AA-DD Model\", Section 9.8 \"AA-DD and the Current Account Balance\", the current account balance \\nmust be lower at K since both an increase in GNP and a dollar appreciation cause decreases in current \\naccount demand. Thus the equilibrium at K lies below the original iso-CAB line. However, this is only \\nassured if the fiscal expansion occurred due to an increase in G.

Learn how changes in monetary policy affect GNP and the value of the exchange rate in a \\nfloating exchange rate system in the context of the AA-DD model in the long run. \\n2. Understand the adjustment process in the money market, the Forex market, and the G&S \\nmarket. \\nIf expansionary monetary policy occurs when the economy is operating at full employment output, then \\nthe money supply increase will eventually put upward pressure on pri ces. Thus we say that eventually, or \\nin the long run, the aggregate price level will rise and the economy will experience an episode of inflation \\nin the transition. See , for a complete description of this process. \\nHere, we will describe the long-run effects of an increase in the money supply using the AA-DD model. We \\nbreak up the effects into short-run and long-run components. In the short run, the initial money supply \\neffects are felt and investor anticipations about future effects are implemented. In the long run, we allow \\nthe price level to rise. \\nSuppose the economy is originally at a \\nsuperequilibrium, shown as \\npoint F in . The original GNP level is YF, \\nand the exchange rate \\nis E1. YF represents the full-\\nemployment level of output, which also \\nimplies that the natural rate of \\nunemployment prevails. Any \\nmovement of the economy to the right \\nof YF will cause an eventual increase in the \\naggregate price level. Any movement to the \\nleft of YF causes an eventual decrease in the \\nprice level. \\nFigure 10.3 Expansionary Monetary Policy in the \\nLong Run \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

As shown in , , \\nmoney supply changes cause a shift in the AA curve. More specifically, an increase in the money supply \\nwill cause AA to shift upward (i.e., ↑MS is an AA up-shifter). This is depicted in the diagram as a shift \\nfrom the AA line to the red A′A′ line. \\nIn the long-run adjustment story, several different changes in exogenous variables will occur sequentially, \\nthus it is difficult to describe the quick final result, so we will only describe the transition process in \\npartial detail. \\nPartial Detail \\nThe increase in the money supply causes the first upward shift of the AA curve, shown as step 1 in the \\ndiagram. Since exchange rates adjust much more rapidly than gross national product (GNP), the economy \\nwill quickly adjust to the new A′A′ curve before any change in GNP occurs. That means the first \\nadjustment will be from point F to point G directly above. The exchange rate will increase from E1 to E2, \\nrepresenting a depreciation of the U.S. dollar. \\nThe second effect is caused by changes in investor expectations. Investors generally track important \\nchanges in the economy, including money supply changes, because these changes can h ave important \\nimplications for the returns on their investments. Investors who see an increase in money supply in an \\neconomy at full employment are likely to expect inflation to occur in the future. When investors expect \\nfuture U.S. inflation, and when they consider both domestic and foreign investments, they will respond \\ntoday with an increase in their expected future exchange rate (E$/£e). There are two reasons to expect this \\nimmediate effect: \\n1. Investors are very likely to understand the story we are in the process of explaining now. As we will see \\nbelow, the long-run effect of a money supply increase for an economy (initially, at full employment) is an \\nincrease in the exchange rate (E$/£)— that is, a depreciation of the dollar. If investors believe the exchange \\nrate will be higher next year due to today’s action by the Fed, then it makes sense for them to raise their \\nexpected future exchange rate in anticipation of that effect. Thus the average E$/£e will rise among \\ninvestors who participate in the foreign exchange (Forex) markets.  \\n2. Investors may look to the purchasing power parity (PPP) theory for guidance. PPP is generally interpreted \\nas a long-run theory of exchange rate trends. If PPP holds in the long run, then E$/£ = P$/P£.

If P$ is expected to rise due \\nto inflation, then PPP predicts that the exchange rate (E$/£) will also rise and the dollar will depreciate. \\nThe timing of the change in E$/£e will depend on how quickly investors recognize the money supply \\nchange, compute its likely effect, and incorporate it into their investment plans. Since investors are \\ntypically very quick to adapt to market changes, the expectations effect should take place in the short run, \\nperhaps long before the inflation ever occurs. In some cases, the expectations change may even occur \\nbefore the Fed increases the money supply, if investors anticipate the Fed’s action. \\nThe increase in the expected exchange rate (this means a decrease in the expected future dollar value) \\ncauses a second upward shift of the AA curve, shown as step 2 in the diagram.

The increase in \\nU.S. prices has two effects as shown in. An increase in P$ is both a DD left-shifter and an AA down-shifter. \\nIn step 3, we depict a leftward shift of DD to D′D′. DD shifts left because higher U.S. prices will reduce the \\nreal exchange rate. This makes U.S. G&S relatively more expensive compared with foreign G&S, thus \\nreducing export demand, increasing import demand, and thereby reducing aggregate demand.  \\nIn step 4, we depict a downward shift of A″A″ to A′″A′″. AA shifts down because a higher U.S. price level \\nreduces real money supply. As the real money supply falls, U.S. interest rates rise, leading to an increase \\nin the rate of return for U.S. assets as considered by international investors. This in turn raises th e \\ndemand for U.S. dollars on the Forex, leading to a dollar appreciation. Since this effect occurs for any GNP \\nlevel, the entire AA curve shifts downward. \\nSteps 3 and 4 will both occur simultaneously, and since both are affected by the increase in the pric e level, \\nit is impossible to know which curve will shift faster or precisely how far each curve will shift. However, \\nwe do know two things. First, the AA and DD shifting will continue as long as GNP remains above the full \\nemployment level. Once GNP falls to YF, there is no longer upward pressure on the price level and the \\nshifting will cease. Second, the final equilibrium exchange rate must lie above the original exchange rate. \\nThis occurs because output will revert back to its original level, the price lev el will be higher, and \\naccording to PPP, eventually the exchange rate will have to be higher as well.  \\nThe final equilibrium will be at a point like J, which lies to the left of I. In this transition, the exchange \\nrate will occasionally rise when DD shifts left and will occasionally fall when AA shifts down. Thus the \\neconomy will wiggle its way up and down, from point I to J. Once at point J, there is no reason for prices \\nto rise further and no reason for a change in investor expectations.

Learn how a country’s central bank can intervene to affect the value of the country’s currency in \\na floating exchange rate system. \\n2. Learn the mechanism and purpose of a central bank sterilized intervention in a Forex market. \\nIn a pure floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate is determined as the rate that equalizes private \\nmarket demand for a currency with private market supply. The central bank has no necessary role to play \\nin the determination of a pure floating exchange rate. Nonetheless, sometimes central banks desir e or are \\npressured by external groups to take actions (i.e., intervene) to either raise or lower the exchange rate in a \\nfloating exchange system. When central banks do intervene on a semiregular basis, the system is \\nsometimes referred to as a “dirty float.” There are several reasons such interventions occur. \\nThe first reason central banks intervene is to stabilize fluctuations in the exchange rate. International \\ntrade and investment decisions are much more difficult to make if the exchange rate value is cha nging \\nrapidly. Whether a trade deal or international investment is good or bad often depends on the value of the \\nexchange rate that will prevail at some point in the future. (See , for a discussion of how future exchange \\nrates affect returns on international investments.) If the exchange rate changes rapidly, up or down, \\ntraders and investors will become more uncertain about the profitability of trades and investments and \\nwill likely reduce their international activities. As a consequence, international tra ders and investors tend \\nto prefer more stable exchange rates and will often pressure governments and central banks to intervene \\nin the foreign exchange (Forex) market whenever the exchange rate changes too rapidly.  \\nThe second reason central banks intervene is to reverse the growth in the country’s trade deficit. Trade \\ndeficits (or current account deficits) can rise rapidly if a country’s exchange rate appreciates significantly. \\nA higher currency value will make foreign goods and services (G&S) relatively ch eaper, stimulating \\nimports, while domestic goods will seem relatively more expensive to foreigners, thus reducing exports. \\nThis means a rising currency value can lead to a rising trade deficit. If that trade deficit is viewed as a \\nproblem for the economy, the central bank may be pressured to intervene to reduce the value of the \\ncurrency in the Forex market and thereby reverse the rising trade deficit.

The indirect method is to change \\nthe domestic money supply. The direct method is to intervene directly in the foreign exchange market by \\nbuying or selling currency. \\nIndirect Forex Intervention \\nThe central bank can use an indirect method to raise or lower the exchange rate through domestic money \\nsupply changes. As was shown in , , increases in the domestic U.S. money supply will cause an increase \\nin E$/£, or a dollar depreciation. Similarly, a decrease in the money supply will cause a dollar appreciation.  \\nDespite relatively quick adjustments in assets markets, this type of intervention must traverse from open \\nmarket operations to changes in domestic money supply, domestic interest rates, and exchange rates due \\nto new rates of returns. Thus this method may take several weeks or more for the ef fect on exchange rates \\nto be realized. \\nA second problem with this method is that to affect the exchange rate the central bank must change the \\ndomestic interest rate. Most of the time, central banks use interest rates to maintain stability in domestic \\nmarkets. If the domestic economy is growing rapidly and inflation is beginning to rise, the central bank \\nmay lower the money supply to raise interest rates and help slow down the economy. If the economy is \\ngrowing too slowly, the central bank may raise the money supply to lower interest rates and help spur \\ndomestic expansion. Thus to change the exchange rate using the indirect method, the central bank may \\nneed to change interest rates away from what it views as appropriate for domestic concerns at the \\nmoment. (Below we’ll discuss the method central banks use to avoid this dilemma.) \\nDirect Forex Intervention \\nThe most obvious and direct way for central banks to intervene and affect the exchange rate is to enter the \\nprivate Forex market directly by buying or selling domestic currency. There are two possible transactions. \\nFirst, the central bank can sell domestic currency (let’s use dollars) in exchange for a foreign currency \\n(say, pounds). This transaction will raise the supply of dollars on the Forex (also raising t he demand for \\npounds), causing a reduction in the value of the dollar and thus a dollar depreciation. Of course, when the \\ndollar depreciates in value, the pound appreciates in value with respect to the dollar. Since the central \\nbank is the ultimate source of all dollars (it can effectively print an unlimited amount), it can flood the \\nForex market with as many dollars as it desires. Thus the central bank’s power to reduce the dollar value \\nby direct intervention in the Forex is virtually unlimited.

Instead of selling dollars, it will need to buy dollars in exchange for pounds. The \\nincreased demand for dollars on the Forex by the central bank will raise the value of the dollar, thus \\ncausing a dollar appreciation. At the same time, the increased supply of pounds on the Forex explains why \\nthe pound will depreciate with respect to the dollar. \\nThe ability of a central bank to raise the value of its currency through direct Forex interventions is limited, \\nhowever. In order for the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank (or the Fed) to buy dollars in exchange for pounds, it \\nmust have a stockpile of pound currency (or other pound assets) available to exchange . Such holdings of \\nforeign assets by a central bank are called foreign exchange reserves. Foreign exchange reserves are \\ntypically accumulated over time and held in case an intervention is desired. In the end, the degree to \\nwhich the Fed can raise the dollar value with respect to the pound through direct Forex intervention will \\ndepend on the size of its pound denominated foreign exchange reserves.  \\nIndirect Effect of Direct Forex Intervention \\nThere is a secondary indirect effect that occurs when a central ban k intervenes in the Forex market. \\nSuppose the Fed sells dollars in exchange for pounds in the private Forex. This transaction involves a \\npurchase of foreign assets (pounds) in exchange for U.S. currency. Since the Fed is the ultimate source of \\ndollar currency, these dollars used in the transaction will enter into circulation in the economy in \\nprecisely the same way as new dollars enter when the Fed buys a Treasury bill on the open market. The \\nonly difference is that with an open market operation, the Fed pu rchases a domestic asset, while in the \\nForex intervention it buys a foreign asset. But both are assets all the same and both are paid for with \\nnewly created money. Thus when the Fed buys pounds and sells dollars on the Forex, there will be an \\nincrease in the U.S. money supply. \\nThe higher U.S. money supply will lower U.S. interest rates, reduce the rate of return on U.S. assets as \\nviewed by international investors, and result in a depreciation of the dollar. The direction of this indirect \\neffect is the same as the direct effect. \\nIn contrast, if the Fed were to buy dollars and sell pounds on the Forex, there will be a decrease in the U.S. \\nmoney supply. The lower U.S. money supply will raise U.S. interest rates, increase the rate of return on \\nU.S. assets as viewed by international investors, and result in an appreciation of the dollar.

The direct \\neffect will occur immediately with central bank intervention since the Fed will be affecting today’s supply \\nof dollars or pounds on the Forex. The indirect effect, working through money supply and interest rates, \\nmay take several days or weeks. The sustainability of the direct versus indirect effects is discussed next \\nwhen we introduce the idea of a sterilized Forex intervention. \\nSterilized Forex Interventions \\nThere are many times in which a central bank either wants or is pressured to affect the exchange rate \\nvalue by intervening directly in the foreign exchange market. However, as shown above, direct Forex \\ninterventions will change the domestic money supply. A change in the money supply will affect the \\naverage interest rate in the short run and the price level, and hence the inflation rate, in the long run. \\nBecause central banks are generally entrusted to maintain domestic price stability or to assist in \\nmaintaining appropriate interest rates, a low unemployment rate, and GDP growth, Forex intervention \\nwill often interfere with one or more of their other goals. \\nFor example, if the central bank believes that current interest rates should be raised slowly during the \\nnext several months to slow the growth of the economy and prevent a resurgence of inflation, then a Forex \\nintervention to lower the value of the domestic currency would result in increases in the money supply \\nand a decrease in interest rates, precisely the opposite of what the central bank wants to achieve. Conflicts \\nsuch as this one are typical and usually result in a central bank choosing to sterilize its Forex \\ninterventions. \\nThe intended purpose of a sterilized intervention is to cause a change in the exchange rate while at the \\nsame time leaving the money supply and hence interest rates unaffected. As we will see, the intended \\npurpose is unlikely to be realized in practice. \\nA sterilized foreign exchange intervention occurs when a central bank counters direct intervention in the \\nForex with a simultaneous offsetting transaction in the domestic bond market. For example, suppose the \\nU.S. Fed decides to intervene to lower the value of the U.S. dollar. This would require the Fed to sell \\ndollars and buy foreign currency on the Forex. Sterilization, in this case, involves a Fed open market \\noperation in which it sells Treasury bonds (T-bonds) at the same time and in the same value as the dollar \\nsale in the Forex market.

Suppose the economy is initially in equilibrium at point Fwith GDP (Y1) and exchange rate \\n(E$/£1). Now, suppose the Fed intervenes in the Forex by selling dollars and buying British pounds. The \\ndirect effect on the exchange rate is not represented in the AA-DD diagram. The only way it can have an \\neffect is through the increase in the money \\nsupply, which will shift the AA curve up \\nfrom AA toA′A′. However, sterilization means \\nthe Fed will simultaneously conduct an \\noffsetting open market operation, in this case \\nselling Treasury bonds equal in value to the \\nForex sales. The sale of T-bonds will lower the \\nU.S. money supply, causing an immediate shift \\nof the AA curve back from A′A′ to AA. In fact, \\nbecause the two actions take place on the same \\nday or within the same week at least, the AA \\ncurve does not really shift out at all. Instead, a \\nsterilized Forex intervention maintains the \\nU.S. money supply and thus achieves the Fed’s \\nobjective of maintaining interest rates. \\nHowever, because there is no shift in the AA or DD curves, the equilibrium in the economy will never \\nmove away from point F. This implies that a sterilized Forex intervention not only will not affect GNP, but \\nalso will not affect the exchange rate. This suggests the impossibility of the Fed’s overall objective to lower \\nthe dollar value while maintaining interest rates. \\nEmpirical studies of the effects of sterilized Forex interventions tend to support the results of this simple \\nmodel. In other words, real-world sterilizations have generally been ineffective in achieving any lasting \\neffect upon a country’s currency value. \\nFigure 10.5 Sterilization in the AA-DD Model \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If a central bank makes a substantial intervention in the Forex \\nover a short period, this will certainly change the supply or demand of curre ncy and have an immediate \\neffect on the exchange rate on those days. \\nA more lasting impact can occur if the intervention leads investors to change their expectations about the \\nfuture. This could happen if investors are not sure whether the central bank is sterilizing its interventions. \\nKnowing that sterilization is occurring would require a careful observation of several markets unless the \\nFed announces its policy. However, rather than announcing a sterilized intervention, a central bank that \\nwants to affect expectations should announce the Forex intervention while hiding its offsetting open \\nmarket operation. In this way, investors may be fooled into thinking that the Forex intervention will lower \\nthe future dollar value and thus may adjust their expectations. \\nIf investors are fooled, they will raise E$/£e in anticipation of the future dollar depreciation. The increase \\nin E$/£e will shift the AA curve upward, resulting in an increase in GNP and a depreciation of the dollar.

Preview the discussion about fixed exchange rate systems, their varieties, and their mechanisms. \\nThis chapter begins by defining several types of fixed exchange rate systems, including the gold standard, \\nthe reserve currency standard, and the gold exchange standard. Theprice-specie flow mechanism is \\ndescribed for the gold standard. It continues with other modern fixed exchange variations such as fixing a \\ncurrency to a basket of several other currencies, crawling pegs, fixing within a band or range of exchange \\nrates, currency boards, and finally the most extreme way to fix a currency: adopting another country’s \\ncurrency as your own, as is done with dollarization or euroization. \\nThe chapter proceeds with the basic mechanics of a reserve currency standard in which a country fixes its \\ncurrency to another’s. In general, a country’s central bank must intervene in the foreign exchange (Forex) \\nmarkets, buying foreign currency whenever there is excess supply (resulting in \\na balance of payments surplus) and selling foreign currency whenever there is excess demand (resulting in \\nabalance of payments deficit). These actions will achieve the fixed exchange rate version of the interest \\nparity condition in which interest rates are equalized across countries.

Recognize the varieties of ways that exchange rates can be fixed to a particular value. \\n2. Understand the basic operation and the adjustment mechanism of a gold standard. \\nThere are two basic systems that can be used to determine the exchange rate between one country’s \\ncurrency and another’s: a floating exchange rate system and a fixed exchange rate system. \\nUnder a floating exchange rate system, the value of a country’s currency is determined by the supply and \\ndemand for that currency in exchange for another in a private market operated by major international \\nbanks. \\nIn contrast, in a fixed exchange rate system, a country’s government announces (or decrees) what its \\ncurrency will be worth in terms of something else and also sets up therules of exchange. The “something \\nelse” to which a currency value is set and the “rules of exchange” determine the type of fixed exchange rate \\nsystem, of which there are many. For example, if the government sets its currency value in terms of a fixed \\nweight of gold, then we have a gold standard. If the currency value is set to a fixed amount of another \\ncountry’s currency, then it is a reserve currency standard. \\nAs we review several ways in which a fixed exchange rate system can work, we will highlight some of the \\nadvantages and disadvantages of the system. In anticipation, it is worth noting that one key advantage of \\nfixed exchange rates is the intention to eliminate exchange rate risk, which can greatly enhance \\ninternational trade and investment. A second key advantage is the discipline a fixed exchange rate system \\nimposes on a country’s monetary authority, with the intention of inducing a much lower inflation rate. \\nThe Gold Standard \\nMost people are aware that at one time the world operated under something called a gold standard. Some \\npeople today, reflecting back on the periods of rapid growth and prosperity that occurred when the world \\nwas on a gold standard, have suggested that the world abandon its current mixture of fixed and floating \\nexchange rate systems and return to this system. (For a discussion of some pros and cons see  Alan \\nGreenspan’s remarks on this from the early 1980s. [1] See Murray Rothbard’s article for an argument in \\nfavor of a return to the gold standard. [2]) Whether or not countries seriously consider this in the future, it \\nis instructive to understand the workings of a gold standard, especially since, historically, it is the first \\nmajor international system of fixed exchange rates.

Before the enactment of a gold standard, countries were generally using \\na Bimetallic standard consisting of both gold and silver. [3] The earliest establishment of a gold standard \\nwas in Great Britain in 1821, followed by Australia in 1852 and Canada in 1853. The United States \\nestablished its gold standard system with the Coinage Act of 1873, somet imes known as “The Crime of \\n’73.” [4] The gold standard was abandoned in the early days of the Great Depression. Britain dropped the \\nstandard in 1931, the United States in 1933. \\nThe rules of a gold standard are quite simple. First, a country’s government declares that its issued \\ncurrency (it may be coin or paper currency) will exchange for a weight in gold. For example, in the United \\nStates during the late 1800s and early 1900s, the government set the dollar exchange rate to gold at the \\nrate $20.67 per troy ounce. During the same period, Great Britain set its currency at the rate £4.24 per \\ntroy ounce. Second, in a pure gold standard, a country’s government declares that it will freely exchange \\ncurrency for actual gold at the designated exchange rate. This “rule of exchange” means that anyone can \\ngo to the central bank with coin or currency and walk out with pure gold. Conversely, one could also walk \\nin with pure gold and walk out with the equivalent in coin or currency. \\nBecause the government bank must always be prepared to give out gold in exchange for coin and currency \\non demand, it must maintain a storehouse of gold. That store of gold is referred to as “gold reserves.” That \\nis, the central bank maintains a reserve of gold so that it can always fulfill its promise of exchange. As \\ndiscussed in , , a well-functioning system will require that the central bank always have an adequate \\namount of reserves. \\nThe two simple rules, when maintained, guarantee that the exchange rate between dollars and pounds \\nremains constant. Here’s why. \\nFirst, the dollar/pound exchange rate is defined as the ratio of the two-currency-gold exchange rates. \\nThus \\n \\nNext, suppose an individual wants to exchange $4.875 for one pound. Following the exchange rules, this \\nperson can enter the central bank in the United States and exchange dollars for gold to get \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If many countries define the value of their \\nown currency in terms of a weight of gold and agree to exchange gold freely at that rate with all who desire \\nto exchange, then all these countries will have fixed currency exchange rates with respect to each other.  \\nPrice-Specie Flow Mechanism \\nThe price-specie flow mechanism is a description about how adjustments to shocks or changes are \\nhandled within a pure gold standard system. Although there is some disagreement whether the gold \\nstandard functioned as described by this mechanism, the mechanism does fix the basic principles of how a \\ngold standard is supposed to work. \\nConsider the United States and United Kingdom operating under a pure gold standard. Suppose there is a \\ngold discovery in the United States. This will represent a shock to the system. Under a gold standard, a \\ngold discovery is like digging up money, which is precisely what inspired so many people to  rush to \\nCalifornia after 1848 to strike it rich. \\nOnce the gold is unearthed, the prospectors bring it into town and proceed to the national bank where it \\ncan be exchanged for coin and currency at the prevailing dollar/gold exchange rate. The new currency in \\ncirculation represents an increase in the domestic money supply. \\nIndeed, it is this very transaction that explains the origins of the gold and silver standards in the first \\nplace. The original purpose of banks was to store individuals’ precious metal wealth and to provide \\nexchangeable notes that were backed by the gold holdings in the vault. Thus rather than carrying around \\nheavy gold, one could carry lightweight paper money. Before national or central banks were founded, \\nindividual commercial banks issued their own currencies, which circulated together  with many other bank \\ncurrencies. However, it was also common for governments to issue coins that were made directly from \\ngold or silver. \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The price-specie flow mechanism describes the \\nadjustment through goods markets. \\nFirst, let’s assume that the money increase occurs in an economy that is not growing— that is, with a fixed \\nlevel of GDP. Also assume that both purchasing power parity (PPP) and interest rate parity (IRP) holds. \\nPPP implies an equalization of the cost of a market basket of goods between the United States and the \\nUnited Kingdom at the current fixed exchange rate. IRP implies an equalization of the ra tes of return on \\ncomparable assets in the two countries. \\nAs discussed in , , when the U.S. money supply increases, and when there is no subsequent increase in \\noutput, the prices of goods and services will begin to rise. This inflationary effect occurs beca use more \\nmoney is chasing (i.e., demanding) the same amount of goods and services. As the price level rises in an \\neconomy open to international trade, domestic goods become more expensive relative to foreign goods. \\nThis will induce domestic residents to increase demand for foreign goods; hence import demand will rise. \\nForeign consumers will also find domestic goods more expensive, so export supply will fall. The result is a \\ndemand for a current account deficit. To make these transactions possible in a gold standard, currency \\nexchange will take place as follows. \\nU.S. residents wishing to buy cheaper British goods will first exchange dollars for gold at the U.S. central \\nbank. Then they will ship that gold to the United Kingdom to exchange for the pounds that can be used to \\nbuy UK goods. As gold moves from the United States to the United Kingdom, the money supply in the \\nUnited States falls while the money supply in the United Kingdom rises. Less money in the United States \\nwill eventually reduce prices, while more money in the United Kingdom will raise prices. This means that \\nthe prices of goods will move together until purchasing power parity holds again. Once PPP holds, there is \\nno further incentive for money to move between countries. There will continue to be demand for UK \\ngoods by U.S. residents, but this will balance with the United Kingdom demands for similarly priced U.S. \\ngoods. Hence, the trade balance reverts to zero. \\nThe adjustment process in the financial market under a gold standard will work through c hanges in \\ninterest rates. When the U.S. money supply rises after the gold discovery, average interest rates will begin \\nto fall. Lower U.S. interest rates will make British assets temporarily more attractive, and U.S. investors \\nwill seek to move investments to the United Kingdom.

Investors trade dollars for gold in the United States and move that gold to the United \\nKingdom where it is exchanged for pounds and used to purchase UK assets. Thus the  U.S. money supply \\nwill begin to fall, causing an increase in U.S. interest rates, while the UK money supply rises, leading to a \\ndecrease in UK interest rates. The interest rates will move together until interest rate parity again holds.  \\nIn summary, adjustment under a gold standard involves the flow of gold between countries, resulting in \\nequalization of prices satisfying purchasing power parity (PPP) and/or equalization of rates of return \\non assets satisfying interest rate parity (IRP) at the current fixed exchange rate. The only requirement \\nfor the government to maintain this type of fixed exchange rate system is to maintain the fixed price of its \\ncurrency in terms of gold and to freely and readily exchange currency for gold on demand. \\nReserve Currency Standard \\nIn a reserve currency system, another country’s currency takes the role that gold played in a gold \\nstandard. In other words a country fixes its own currency value to a unit of another country’s currency. \\nFor example, suppose Britain decided to fix its currency to the dollar at the exchange rate E$/£ = 1.50. To \\nmaintain this fixed exchange rate, the Bank of England would stand ready to exchange pounds for dollars \\n(or dollars for pounds) on demand at the specified exchange rate. To accomplish this, the Bank of England \\nwould need to hold dollars on reserve in case there was ever any excess demand for dollars in exchange \\nfor pounds on the Forex. In the gold standard, the central bank held gold to exchange for its own \\ncurrency; with a reserve currency standard, it must hold a stock of the reserve currency. Always, the \\nreserve currency is the currency to which the country fixes. \\nA reserve currency standard is the typical method for fixing a currency today. Most countries that fix its \\nexchange rate will fix to a currency that either is prominently used in international transactions or is the \\ncurrency of a major trading partner. Thus many countries fixing their exchange rate today fix to the U.S. \\ndollar because it is the most widely traded currency internationally. Alternatively, fourteen African \\ncountries that were former French colonies had established the CFA franc zone and fixed the CFA franc \\n(current currency used by these African countries) to the French franc. Since 1999, the CFA franc has been \\nfixed to the euro. Namibia, Lesotho, and Swaziland are all a part of the common monetary area (CMA) \\nand fix their currency to the South African rand. \\nGold Exchange Standard ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In general, it includes the following two rules: \\n1. A reserve currency is chosen. All nonreserve countries agree to fix their exchange rates to the reserve at \\nsome announced rate. To maintain the fixity, these nonreserve countries will hold a stockpile of reserve \\ncurrency assets. \\n2. The reserve currency country agrees to fix its currency value to a weight in gold. Finally, the reserve \\ncountry agrees to exchange gold for its own currency with other central banks within the sys tem on \\ndemand. \\nOne key difference in this system from a gold standard is that the reserve country does not agree to \\nexchange gold for currency with the general public, only with other central banks.  \\nThe system works exactly like a reserve currency system from the perspective of the nonreserve countries. \\nHowever, if over time the nonreserve countries accumulate the reserve currency, they can demand \\nexchange for gold from the reserve country central bank. In this case, gold reserves will flow away from \\nthe reserve currency country. \\nThe fixed exchange rate system set up after World War II was a gold exchange standard, as was the system \\nthat prevailed between 1920 and the early 1930s. The post– World War II system was agreed to by the \\nallied countries at a conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in the United States in June 1944. As \\na result, the exchange rate system after the war also became known as the Bretton Woods system. \\nAlso proposed at Bretton Woods was the establishment of an international institution to help regulate the \\nfixed exchange rate system. This institution was theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF’s main \\nmission was to help maintain the stability of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system.  \\nOther Fixed Exchange Rate Variations \\nBasket of Currencies \\nCountries that have several important trading partners, or who fear that one currency may be too volatile \\nover an extended period, have chosen to fix their currency to a basket of several other currencies. This \\nmeans fixing to a weighted average of several currencies. This method is best understood by considering \\nthe creation of a composite currency. Consider the following hypothetical example: a new unit of money \\nconsisting of 1 euro, 100 Japanese yen, and one U.S. dollar. Call this new un it a Eur-yen-dol.

The country would then need to maintain reserves in one or \\nmore of the three currencies to satisfy excess demand or supply of its currency on the Forex.  \\nA better example of a composite currency is found in the SDR. SDR stands forspecial drawing rights. It is \\na composite currency created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). One SDR now consists of a fixed \\nquantity of U.S. dollars, euros, Japanese yen, and British pounds. For more  info on the SDR see the IMF \\nfactsheet. [5] Now Saudi Arabia officially fixes its currency to the SDR. Botswana fixes to a basket \\nconsisting of the SDR and the South African rand. \\nCrawling Pegs \\nA crawling peg refers to a system in which a country fixes its exchange rate but also changes the fixed rate \\nat periodic or regular intervals. Central bank interventions in the Forex may occur to maintain the \\ntemporary fixed rate. However, central banks can avoid interventions and save reserves by adjusting the \\nfixed rate instead. Since crawling pegs are adjusted gradually, they can help eliminate some exchange rate \\nvolatility without fully constraining the central bank with a fixed rate. In 2010 Bolivia, China, Ethiopia, \\nand Nicaragua were among several countries maintaining a crawling peg.  \\nPegged within a Band \\nIn this system, a country specifies a central exchange rate together with a percentage allowable deviation, \\nexpressed as plus or minus some percentage. For example, Denmark, an EU member country, does not \\nyet use the euro but participates in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM2). Under this system, Denmark \\nsets its central exchange rate to 7.46038 krona per euro and allows fluctuations of the exchange rate \\nwithin a 2.25 percent band. This means the krona can fluctuate from a low of 7.63 kr/€ to a high of 7.29 \\nkr/€. (Recall that the krona is at a high with the smaller exchange rate value since the kr/euro rate \\nrepresents the euro value.) If the market determined floating exchange rate rises above or falls below the \\nbands, the Danish central bank must intervene in the Forex.

In creating the euro -zone among twelve of the \\nEuropean Union (EU) countries, these European nations have given up their own national currencies and \\nhave adopted the currency issued by the European Central Bank. This is a case of euroization. Since all \\ntwelve countries now share the euro as a common currency, their exchange rates are effectively fixed to \\neach other at a 1:1 ratio. As other countries in the EU join the common currency, they too will be forever \\nfixing their exchange rate to the euro. (Note, however, that although all countries that use the euro are \\nfixed to each other, the euro itself floats with respect to external currencies such as the U.S. dollar.)  \\nOther examples of adopting another currency as one’s own are the countries of Panama, Ecuador, and El \\nSalvador. These countries have all chosen to adopt the U.S. dollar as their national currency of circulation. \\nThus they have chosen the most extreme method of assuring a fixed exc hange rate.

Learn how the interest rate parity condition changes in a system of credible fixed exchange rates. \\nOne of the main differences between a fixed exchange rate system and a floating system is that under fixed \\nexchange rates the central bank will have to “do something” periodically. In contrast, in a floating system, \\nthe central bank can just sit back and watch since it has no responsibility for the value of the exchange \\nrate. In a pure float, the exchange rate is determined entirely by private transactions.  \\nHowever, in a fixed exchange rate system, the central bank will need to intervene in the foreign exchange \\nmarket, perhaps daily, if it wishes to maintain the credibility of the exchange rate.  \\nWe’ll use the AA-DD model to explain why. Although the AA-DD model was created under the \\nassumption of a floating exchange rate, we can reinterpret the model in light of a fixed exchange rate \\nassumption. This means we must look closely at the interest rate parity condition, which represents the \\nequilibrium condition in the foreign exchange market. \\nRecall that the AA-DD model assumes the exchange rate is determined as a result of investor incentives to \\nmaximize their rate of return on investments. The model ignores the potential effect of importers and \\nexporters on the exchange rate value. That is, the model does not presume that purchasing power parity \\nholds. As such, the model describes a world economy that is very open to international capital flows and \\ninternational borrowing and lending. This is a reasonable representation of the world in the early twenty -\\nfirst century, but would not be the best characterization of the world in the mid-1900s when capital \\nrestrictions were more common. Nonetheless, the requisite behavior of central banks under fixed \\nexchange rates would not differ substantially under either assumption.  \\nWhen investors seek the greatest rate of return on their investments internationally, we saw that the \\nexchange rate will adjust until interest rate parity holds. Consider interest rate parity (IRP) for a \\nparticular investment comparison between the United States and the United Kingdom. IRP means \\nthat RoR$ = RoR£. We can write this equality out in its complete form to get \\n \\nwhere the left-hand side is the U.S. interest rate and the right side is the more complicated rate of return \\nformula for a UK deposit with interest rate i£.

The last term on the right represents the expected appreciation (if positive) or depreciation (if \\nnegative) of the pound value with respect to the U.S. dollar. \\nIn a floating exchange rate system, the value of this term is based on investor expectations about the \\nfuture exchange rate as embodied in the term E$/£e, which determines the degree to which investors \\nbelieve the exchange rate will change over their investment period.  \\nIf these same investors were operating in a fixed exchange rate system, however, and if they believed the \\nfixed exchange rate would indeed remain fixed, then the investors’ expected exchange rate should be set \\nequal to the current fixed spot exchange rate. In other words, under credible fi xed exchange \\nrates, E$/£e = E$/£. Investors should not expect the exchange rate to change from its current fixed value. \\n(We will consider a case in which the investors’ expected exchange rate does not equal the fixed spot rate \\nin , .) \\nWith E$/£e = E$/£, the right side of the above expression becomes zero, and the interest rate parity \\ncondition under fixed exchange rates becomes \\ni$ = i£. \\nThus for interest rate parity to hold in a fixed exchange rate system, the interest rates between two \\ncountries must be equal. \\nIndeed, the reason this condition in a floating system is called “interest rate parity” rather than “rate of \\nreturn parity” is because of our history with fixed exchange rates. Before 1973, most of the world had \\nmaintained fixed exchange rates for most of the time. We can see now that under fixed exchange rates, \\nrates of return in each country are simply the interest rates on individual deposits. In other words, in a \\nfixed system, which is what most countries had through much of their histories, inte rest rate parity means \\nthe equality of interest rates. When the fixed exchange rate system collapsed, economists and others \\ncontinued to use the now-outdated terminology: interest rate parity. Inertia in language usage is why the \\ntraditional term continues to be applied (somewhat inappropriately) even today. \\nKEY TAKEAWAY  \\n• For interest rate parity to hold in a fixed exchange rate system, the interest rates between two \\ncountries must be equal. \\nEXERCISE  ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn what a central bank must do to maintain a credible fixed exchange rate in a reserve \\ncurrency system. \\nIn a fixed exchange rate system, most of the transactions of one currency for another will take place in the \\nprivate market among individuals, \\nbusinesses, and international banks. \\nHowever, by fixing the exchange rate the \\ngovernment would have declared illegal any \\ntransactions that do not occur at the \\nannounced rate. However, it is very unlikely \\nthat the announced fixed exchange rate will \\nat all times equalize private demand for \\nforeign currency with private supply. In a \\nfloating exchange rate system, the exchange \\nrate adjusts to maintain the supply and \\ndemand balance. In a fixed exchange rate \\nsystem, it becomes the responsibility of the \\ncentral bank to maintain this balance. \\nThe central bank can intervene in the private \\nforeign exchange (Forex) market whenever needed by acting as a buyer and seller of currency of last \\nresort. To see how this works, consider the following example. \\nSuppose the United States establishes a fixed exchange rate to the British pound at the rate  Ē$/£. In Figure \\n11.1 \"Central Bank Intervention to Maintain a Fixed Exchange Rate\", we depict an initial private market \\nForex equilibrium in which the supply of pounds (S£) equals demand (D£) at the fixed exchange rate \\n(Ē$/£). But suppose, for some unspecified reason, the demand for pounds on the private Forex rises one \\nday toD′£. \\nAt the fixed exchange rate (Ē$/£), private market demand for pounds is now Q2, whereas supply of pounds \\nis Q1. This means there is excess demand for pounds in exchange for U.S. dollars on the private Forex.  \\nFigure 11.1 Central Bank Intervention to Maintain a \\nFixed Exchange Rate \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In this way, the \\nequilibrium exchange rate is \\nautomatically maintained at the \\nfixed level. \\nAlternatively, consider Figure 11.2 \\n\"Another Central Bank Intervention to \\nMaintain a Fixed Exchange Rate\", in \\nwhich again the supply of pounds (S£) \\nequals demand (D£) at the fixed \\nexchange rate (Ē$/£).

At the \\nfixed exchange rate (Ē$/£), private market demand for pounds is now Q2, whereas supply of pounds is Q1. \\nThis means there is excess supply of pounds in exchange for U.S. dollars on the private Forex.  \\nIn this case, an excess supply of pounds also means an excess demand for dollars in exchange for pounds. \\nThe U.S. central bank can satisfy the extra dollar demand by entering the Forex and selling dollars in \\nexchange for pounds.

Learn the definitions and usage of balance of payments deficits and surpluses in a fixed exchange \\nrate system. \\nTo maintain a fixed exchange rate, the central bank will need to automatically intervene in the private \\nforeign exchange (Forex) by buying or selling domestic currency in exchange for the foreign reserve \\ncurrency. Clearly, in order for these transactions to be possible, a country’s central bank will need a stock \\nof the foreign reserve currency at the time the fixed exchange rate system begins. Subsequently, if excess \\ndemand for foreign currency in some periods is balanced with excess supply in other periods , then falling \\nreserves in some periods (when dollars are bought on the Forex) will be offset with rising reserves in other \\nperiods (when dollars are sold in the Forex) and a central bank will be able to maintain the fixed exchange \\nrate. Problems arise, though, if a country begins to run out of foreign reserves. But before discussing that \\nsituation, we need to explain some terminology. \\nWhen the central bank buys domestic currency and sells the foreign reserve currency in the private \\nForex, the transaction indicates a balance of payments deficit. Alternatively, when the central bank sells \\ndomestic currency and buys foreign currency in the Forex, the transaction indicates a balance of \\npayments surplus. \\nCentral bank transactions are recorded in an account titledofficial reserve transactions. It is found in the \\nfinancial account of the balance of payments.

If over some period the  official \\nreserve balance is falling, then the country is running a balance of payments deficit.

This implies that domestic demand for foreign \\ncurrency (to buy imports) exceeds foreign demand for domestic currency (to buy our exports). Assuming \\nno additional foreign demands for domestic currency on the financial account (to keep the exchange rate \\nfixed), the central bank would need to intervene by selling foreign currency in exchange for domestic \\ncurrency. This would lead to a reduction of foreign reserves and hence a balance of payments deficit.

To satisfy the excess \\ndemand (excess supply), the central bank will automatically intervene on the Forex and sell (buy) foreign \\nreserves. Thus by tracking sales or purchases of foreign reserves in the official reserve account, we can \\ndetermine if the country has a balance of payments deficit or surplus.  \\nNote that in a floating exchange rate system, a central bank can intervene in the private Forex to push the \\nexchange rate up or down. Thus official reserve transactions can show rising or falling foreign reserves \\nand hence suggest a balance of payments deficit or surplus in a floating exchange system. However, it is \\nnot strictly proper to describe a country with floating exchange rates as having a balance of payment \\ndeficit or surplus. The reason is that interventions are not necessary in a floating exchange rate. In a \\nfloating system, an imbalance between supply and demand in the private Forex is relieved by  a change in \\nthe exchange rate. Thus there need never be an imbalance in the balance of payments in a floating system.  \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• When the central bank buys domestic currency and sells the foreign reserve currency in the \\nprivate Forex, the transaction indicates a balance of payments deficit. \\n• When the central bank sells domestic currency and buys foreign currency in the Forex, the \\ntransaction indicates a balance of payments surplus. \\n• A balance of payments deficit (surplus) arises whenever there is excess demand for (supply of) \\nforeign currency on the private Forex at the official fixed exchange rate. \\nEXERCISE  \\n1.

Learn the five different reasons why trade between countries may occur. \\nTill now we have said that a central bank must intervene in the foreign exchange (Forex) market whenever \\nthere is excess demand or supply of foreign currency. However, we might consider what would happen if \\nthe central bank did not intervene. Surely the government could simply mandate that all Forex \\ntransactions take place at the official fixed rate and implement severe penalties if anyone is caught trading \\nat a different rate. A black market arises, however, when exchanges for foreign currency take place at an \\nunofficial (or illegal) exchange rate. \\nLet’s consider why a black market may arise. Suppose the United States fixes its exchange rate to the \\nBritish pound at the rate Ē$/£. This is indicated in Figure 11.3 \"Conditions for a Black Market\" as a \\nhorizontal line drawn at Ē$/£. \\nSuppose further that demand for \\npounds (Q1) on the private Forex \\nexceeds supply (Q2) at the official \\nfixed exchange rate, but the \\ncentral bank does not intervene to \\ncorrect the imbalance. In this \\ncase, suppliers of pounds will \\ncome to the market \\nwith Q2 quantity of pounds, but \\nmany people who would like to \\nbuy pounds will not find a willing \\nsupplier. Those individuals and \\nbusinesses demanding the excess \\n(Q1 − Q2) will leave the market \\nempty-handed. Now if this were a one-time occurrence, the unsatisfied demand might be fulfilled in later \\ndays when excess supply of pounds comes to the market. However, a more likely scenario is that this \\nFigure 11.3 Conditions for a Black Market \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

With each passing day of unsatisfied demand, total \\nunsatisfied demand grows insidiously. \\nTogether with the excess demand is a willingness to pay more than the official rate to obtain currency. \\nSince the market equilibrium rate is at E$/£1, excess demanders would be willing to pay more dollars to \\nobtain a pound than is required in the official market. The willingn ess to pay more creates a profit-making \\npossibility. Suppose an individual or business obtains pounds, perhaps by selling goods in Britain and \\nbeing paid in foreign currency. This person could convert the pounds for dollars at the official rate or, if he \\nor she wants to make more money, could trade the currency “unofficially” at a higher exchange rate. The \\nonly problem is finding someone willing to buy the pounds at the unofficial rate. This turns out rarely to \\nbe a problem. Wherever black markets develop, unofficial traders find each other on street corners, at \\nhotels, and even within banks. \\nThus a central bank doesn’t absolutely need to intervene in the Forex market in a fixed exchange rate \\nsystem. However, if it does not, a black market will very likely arise and the central bank will lose control \\nof the exchange rate. One main purpose of fixed exchange rates, namely the certainty of knowing what the \\ncurrency will exchange for, is also lost since traders will have to decide whether to trade officially or \\nunofficially. Furthermore, the black market exchange rate typically rises and falls with changes in supply \\nand demand, thus one is never sure what that rate will be. \\nIn light of the potential for black markets to arise, if a government wishes to maintain a  credible fixed \\nexchange rate, regular intervention to eliminate excess demand or supply of foreign currency is indeed \\nrequired. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• A black market arises when exchanges for foreign currency take place at an unofficial (or illegal) \\nexchange rate. \\n• If a central bank does not intervene regularly in the Forex market, a black market will very likely \\narise and the central bank will lose control of the exchange rate. \\nEXERCISE  \\n1.

Preview the comparative statics results from the AA-DD model with fixed exchange rates. \\nThis chapter uses the AA-DD model to describe the effects of fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policy \\nunder a system of fixed exchange rates. Fiscal and monetary policies are the primary tools governments \\nuse to guide the macroeconomy. With fixed exchange rates, a third policy option becomes available — that \\nis, exchange rate policy. Thus we also examine the effects of changes in the fixed exchange rate. These \\nexchange rate changes are called devaluations (sometimes competitive devaluations) and revaluations. \\nIn introductory macroeconomics courses, students learn how government policy levers can be used to \\ninfluence the level of the gross national product (GNP), inflation rate, unemployment rate, and interest \\nrates. In this chapter, that analysis is expanded to an open economy (i.e., one open to trade) and to the \\neffects on exchange rates and current account balances. \\nResults \\nUsing the AA-DD model, several important relationships between key economic variables are shown:  \\n• A monetary policy (change in MS) has no effect on GNP or the exchange rate in a fixed exchange system. \\nAs such, the trade balance, unemployment, and interest rates all remain the same as well. Monetary policy \\nbecomes ineffective as a policy tool in a fixed exchange rate system. \\n• Expansionary fiscal policy (↑G, ↑TR, or ↓T) causes an increase in GNP while maintaining the fixed \\nexchange rate and constant interest rates. The trade balance and unemployment are both reduced.  \\n• Contractionary fiscal policy (↓G, ↓TR, or ↑T) reduces GNP while maintaining the fixed exchange rate and \\nconstant interest rates. The trade balance and unemployment both rise.  \\n• A competitive devaluation lowers the currency value and causes an increase in GNP. Unemployment falls, \\ninterest rates remain the same, and the trade balance rises. \\n• A currency revaluation raises the currency value and causes a decrease in GNP. Unemployment rises, \\ninterest rates remain the same, and the trade balance falls. \\n• Monetary expansion by the reserve currency country forces the domestic country to run a balance of \\npayments surplus to maintain its fixed exchange rate. The resulting money supply increase causes \\ndomestic interest rates to fall to maintain equality with the falling foreign interest rates. Domestic GNP \\nremains fixed, as do unemployment and the trade balance.

A crisis can force a \\ncountry to devalue its currency or move to a floating exchange rate. To postpone the crisis, countries can \\nsometimes borrow money from organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  \\n• Anticipation of a balance of payments crisis can induce investors to sell domestic assets in favor of foreign \\nassets. This is called capital flight. Capital flight will worsen a balance of payments problem and can \\ninduce a crisis to occur. \\nConnections \\nThe AA-DD model was developed to describe the interrelationships of macroeconomic variables within an \\nopen economy. Since some of these macroeconomic variables are controlled by the government, we can \\nuse the model to understand the likely effects of government policy changes. The main levers the \\ngovernment controls are monetary policy (changes in the money supply), fiscal policy (changes in the \\ngovernment budget), and exchange rate policy (setting the fixed exchang e rate value). In this chapter, the \\nAA-DD model is applied to understand government policy effects in the context of a fixed exchange rate \\nsystem. In Chapter 10 \"Policy Effects with Floating Exchange Rates\", we considered these same \\ngovernment policies in the context of a floating exchange rate system. In  Chapter 13 \"Fixed versus \\nFloating Exchange Rates\", we’ll compare fixed and floating exchange rate systems and discuss the pros \\nand cons of each system. \\nIt is important to recognize that these results are what “would” happen under the full set of assumptions \\nthat describe the AA-DD model. These effects may or may not happen in reality. Nevertheless, the model \\nsurely captures some of the simple cause-and-effect relationships and therefore helps us to understand \\nthe broader implications of policy changes. Thus even if in reality many more elements (not described in \\nthe model) may act to influence the key endogenous variables, the AA -DD model at least gives a more \\ncomplete picture of some of the expected tendencies. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• The main objective of the AA-DD model is to assess the effects of monetary, fiscal, and exchange \\nrate policy changes.

More specifically, an increase in the money supply will cause AA to shift upward \\n(i.e., ↑MS is an AA up-shifter). This is depicted in the diagram as a shift from the red  AA to the blue A′A′ \\nline. \\nThe money supply increase puts upward pressure on the exchange rate in the following way. First, a \\nmoney supply increase causes a reduction in U.S. interest rates. This in turn reduces the rate of return on  \\nU.S. assets below the rate of return on similar assets in Britain. Thus international investors will begin to \\ndemand more pounds in exchange for dollars on the private Forex to take advantage of the relatively \\nhigher RoR of British assets. In a floating exchange system, excess demand for pounds would cause the \\npound to appreciate and the dollar to depreciate. In other words, the exchange rate  E$/£ would rise. In the \\ndiagram, this would correspond to a movement to the new A′A′ curve at point G. \\nHowever, because the country maintains a fixed exchange rate, excess demand for pounds on the private \\nForex will automatically be relieved by Fed intervention. The Fed will supply the excess pounds demanded \\nby selling reserves of pounds in exchange for dollars at the fixed exchange rate. As we showed in Chapter  \\n10 \"Policy Effects with Floating Exchange Rates\", Section 10.5 \"Foreign Exchange Interventions with \\nFloating Exchange Rates\", Fed sales of foreign currency result in a reduction in the U.S. money supply. \\nThis is because when the Fed buys dollars in the private Forex, it is taking those dollars out of circulation \\nand thus out of the money supply. Since a reduction of the money supply causes AA to shift back down, \\nthe final effect will be that the AA curve returns to its original position. This is shown as the up and down \\nmovement of the AA curve in the diagram. The final equilibrium is the same as the original at point  F. \\nThe AA curve must return to the same original position because the exchange rate must remain f ixed \\nat Ē$/£. This implies that the money supply reduction due to Forex intervention will exactly offset the \\nmoney supply expansion induced by the original open market operation. Thus the money supply will \\ntemporarily rise but then will fall back to its original level. Maintaining the money supply at the same level \\nalso assures that interest rate parity is maintained. Recall that in a fixed exchange rate system, interest \\nrate parity requires equalization of interest rates between countries (i.e., i$ =i£). If the money supply did \\nnot return to the same level, interest rates would not be equalized.  \\nThus after final adjustment occurs, there are no effects from expansionary monetary policy in a fixed \\nexchange rate system. The exchange rate will not change and there will be no effect on equilibrium GNP.

In the AA-DD model, a decrease in the money supply shifts the AA curve \\ndownward. The effects will be the opposite of those described above for expansionary monetary policy. A \\ncomplete description is left for the reader as an exercise. \\nThe quick effects, however, are as follows. U.S. contractionary monetary policy with a fixed exchange \\nrate will have no effects within the economy. E$/£, Y$ and the current account balance will all be \\nmaintained or return to their initial levels. \\nDiscussion \\nThis result indicates that monetary policy is ineffective in influencing the economy in a fixed exchange \\nrate system. In contrast, in a floating exchange rate system, monetary policy can either raise or lo wer \\nGNP, at least in the short run. Thus monetary policy has some effectiveness in a floating system, and \\ncentral bank authorities can adjust policy to affect macroeconomic conditions within their economy. For \\nexample, if the economy is growing only sluggishly, or perhaps is contracting, the central bank can raise \\nthe money supply to help spur an expansion of GNP, if the economy has a floating exchange rate. \\nHowever, with a fixed exchange rate, the central bank no longer has this ability. This explains why \\ncountries lose monetary autonomy (or independence) with a fixed exchange rate. The central bank can no \\nlonger have any influence over the interest rate, exchange rate, or the level of GNP.  \\nOne other important comparison worth making is between expansionary  monetary policy in a fixed \\nexchange rate system with sterilized foreign exchange (Forex) interventions in a floating system. In the \\nfirst case, expansionary monetary policy is offset later with a contraction of the money supply caused by \\nautomatic Forex intervention. In the second case, Forex intervention leading to an expansion of the \\nmoney supply is countered with contractionary open market operations. In the first case, the interest rate \\nis maintained to satisfy interest rate parity. In the second case, the interest rate remains fixed by design. \\nClearly, these two situations represent exactly the same set of actions, though in a different order. Thus it \\nmakes sense that the two policies would have the same implications — that is, “no impact” on any of the \\neconomic variables.

Learn how changes in fiscal policy affect GNP, the value of the exchange rate, and the current \\naccount balance in a fixed exchange rate system in the context of the AA-DD model. \\n2. Understand the adjustment process in the money market, the Forex market, and the G&S \\nmarket. \\nIn this section, we use the AA-DD model to assess the effects of fiscal policy in a fixed exchange rate \\nsystem. Recall from Chapter 8 \"National Output Determination\" that fiscal policy refers to any change in \\nexpenditures or revenues within any branch of the government. This means any change in government \\nspending (e.g., transfer payments or taxes) by federal, state, or local governments represents a fiscal \\npolicy change. Since changes in expenditures or revenues will often affect a government budget balance, \\nwe can also say that a change in the government surplus or deficit represents a change in fiscal poli cy. \\nWhen government spending or transfer payments increase, or tax revenues decrease, we refer to it as \\nexpansionary fiscal policy. These actions would also be associated with an increase in the government \\nbudget deficit, or a decrease in its budget surplus. If the government acts to reduce government spending \\nor transfer payments, or increase tax revenues, it is referred to as contractionary fiscal policy. These \\nactions would also be associated with a decrease in the government budget deficit, or an increa se in its \\nbudget surplus. \\nExpansionary Fiscal Policy \\nSuppose the United States fixes its exchange rate to the British pound at the rate  Ē$/£. This is indicated \\nin Figure 12.2 \"Expansionary Fiscal Policy with a Fixed Exchange Rate\" as a horizontal line drawn at Ē$/£. \\nSuppose also that the economy is originally at a superequilibrium shown as point  J with GNP at level Y1. \\nNext, suppose the government decides to increase government spending (or increase transfer payments or \\ndecrease taxes). As shown in Chapter 9 \"The AA-DD Model\", Section 9.3 \"Shifting the DD Curve\", fiscal \\npolicy changes cause a shift in the DD curve. More specifically, an increase in government spending (or an \\nincrease in transfer payments or a decrease in taxes) will cause DD to shift rightwa rd (i.e., ↑G, ↑TR, and \\n↓T all are DD right-shifters).

If the expansionary fiscal \\npolicy occurs due to an increase in \\ntransfer payments or a decrease in \\ntaxes, then disposable income will \\nincrease, leading to an increase in \\nconsumption demand. In either case, \\naggregate demand increases. Before \\nany adjustment occurs, the increase in \\naggregate demand causes aggregate \\ndemand to exceed aggregate supply, \\nwhich will lead to an expansion of \\nGNP. Thus the economy will begin to move rightward from point J. \\nAs GNP rises, so does real money demand, causing an increase in U.S. interest rates. With higher interest \\nrates, the rate of return on U.S. assets rises above that in the United Kingdom and international investors \\nincrease demand for dollars (in exchange for pounds) on the private Forex.

The Fed’s response causes an \\nincrease in the money supply, which in turn will lower interest rates back to their original level. This result \\nis necessary to maintain the fixed exchange rate interest rate parity (IRP) condition of i $ = i£. \\nNote also that as GNP increases in the transition, causing interest rates to rise, this rise is immediately \\ncountered with automatic Fed intervention in the Forex. Thus the exchange rate will never fall below the \\nfixed rate. There will be pressure for the exchange rate to fall, but the Fed will always be there to relieve \\nthe pressure with its intervention. Thus the adjustment path from the original equilibrium at  J to the final \\nequilibrium at K will follow the rightward arrow between the two points along the fixed exchange rate.  \\nThe final result is that expansionary fiscal policy in a fixed exchange rate system will cause an increase \\nin GNP (from Y1 to Y2) and no change in the exchange rate in the short run.

Understand the adjustment process in the money market, the Forex market, and the G&S \\nmarket. \\nIn this section, we use the AA-DD model to assess the effects of exchange rate policy in a fixed exchange \\nrate system. In a sense we can say that the government’s decision to maintain a fixed exchange is the \\ncountry’s exchange rate policy. However, over time, the government does have some discretion \\nconcerning the value of the exchange rate. In this section, we will use “exchange rate policy” to mean \\nchanges in the value of the fixed exchange rate. \\nIf the government lowers the value of its currency with respect to the reserve currenc y or to gold, we call \\nthe change a devaluation. If the government raises the value of its currency with respect to the reserve \\ncurrency or to gold, we call the change a revaluation. The terms devaluation and revaluation should \\nproperly be used only in reference to a government change in the fixed exchange rate since each term \\nsuggests an action being taken. In contrast, natural market changes in supply and demand will result in \\nchanges in the exchange rate in a floating system, but it is not quite right to call these changes \\ndevaluations or revaluations since no concerted action was taken by anyone. Nonetheless, some writers \\nwill sometimes use the terms this way. \\nIn most cases, devaluations and revaluations occur because of persistent balance of payments \\ndisequilibria. We will consider these situations in Chapter 12 \"Policy Effects with Fixed Exchange \\nRates\", Section 12.6 \"Currency Crises and Capital Flight\" on balance of payments crises and capital flight. \\nIn this section, we will consider the basic effects of devaluations and revaluations without assuming any \\nnotable prior events caused these actions to occur. \\nDevaluation \\nSuppose the United States fixes its exchange rate to the British pound at the rate  Ē$/£.

Assume that there was no anticipation of the \\ndevaluation and that it \\ncomes about as a complete \\nsurprise to all market \\nparticipants. \\nThe first effect of the \\ndevaluation, of course, is that \\nthe exchange rate rises. \\nImmediately the economy \\nmoves from F to G on the \\ndiagram. It may seem that this \\nwould move the economy off \\nthe AA curve, but instead the \\nAA curve shifts up with the \\ndevaluation to A′A′. This \\noccurs because the AA curve is a \\nfunction of the expected exchange rate. As long as investors believe that the new exchange rate will n ow \\nremain fixed at its new rate (Ê$/£), the expected future exchange rate will immediately rise to this new level \\nas well. It is this increase in E$/£e that causes AA to shift up. \\nWhen at point G, however, the economy is not at a superequilibrium. Because of the dollar devaluation, \\nthe real exchange rate has increased, making foreign goods relatively more expensive and U.S. goods \\nrelatively cheaper. This raises aggregate demand, which at the new exchange rate ( Ê$/£) is now at the level \\nwhere the exchange rate line crosses the DD curve at point H. \\nSince the economy, for now, lies at G to the left of point H on the DD curve, aggregate demand exceeds \\nsupply. Producers will respond by increasing supply to satisfy the demand, and GNP will begin to rise.  \\nAs GNP rises, real money demand will rise, causing an increase in U.S. interest rates, which will raise the \\nrate of return on U.S. assets. Investors will respond by increasing their demand for U.S. dollars on the \\nforeign exchange (Forex) market, and there will be pressure for a dollar appreciation. \\nFigure 12.3 Effects of a Devaluation \\n \\n \\n', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Learn how monetary policy in the foreign reserve country affects domestic GNP, the value of the \\nexchange rate, and the current account balance in a fixed exchange rate system in the context of \\nthe AA-DD model. \\n2. Understand the adjustment process in the money market, the Forex market, and the G&S \\nmarket. \\nSuppose the United States fixes its exchange rate to the British pound. In this circumstance, the exchange rate system \\nis a reserve currency standard in which the British pound is the reserve currency. The U.S. government is the one that \\nfixes its exchange rate and will hold some quantity of British pounds on reserve so it is able to intervene on the Forex \\nto maintain the credible fixed exchange rate. \\nIt is worth noting that since the United States fixes its exchange rate to the pound, the British pound is, of course, \\nfixed to the U.S. dollar as well. Since the pound is the reserve currency, however, it has a special place in the monetary \\nsystem. The Bank of England, Britain’s central bank, will never need to intervene in the Forex market. It does not \\nneed to hold dollars. Instead, all market pressures for the exchange rate to change will be resolved by U.S. \\nintervention, that is, by the nonreserve currency country. \\nExpansionary Monetary Policy by the Reserve Country \\nNow let’s suppose that the reserve currency country, Britain, undertakes expansionary monetary policy. \\nWe will consider the impact of this change from the vantage point of the United States, the nonreserve \\ncurrency country.

Thus \\ninternational investors will begin to \\ndemand more dollars in exchange for \\npounds on the private Forex to take \\nadvantage of the relatively higher rate \\nof return on U.S. assets. In a floating \\nexchange system, excess demand for \\ndollars would cause the dollar to \\nappreciate and the pound to \\ndepreciate. In other words, the \\nexchange rate (E$/£) would fall. In the diagram, this would correspond to a movement to the new A ′A′ \\ncurve at point G. \\nBecause the country maintains a fixed exchange rate, however, excess demand for dollars on the private \\nForex will automatically be relieved by the U.S. Federal Reserve (or the Fed) intervention. The Fed will \\nsupply the excess dollars demanded by buying pounds in exchange for dollars at the fixed exchange rate. \\nAs we showed in Chapter 10 \"Policy Effects with Floating Exchange Rates\", Section 10.5 \"Foreign \\nExchange Interventions with Floating Exchange Rates\", the foreign currency purchases by the Fed result \\nin an increase in the U.S. money supply. This is because when the Fed sells dollars in the private Forex, \\nthese dollars are entering into circulation and thus become a part of the money supply. Since an increase \\nin the money supply causes AA to shift up, the AA curve will return to its original position to maintain the \\nfixed exchange rate. This is shown as the up-and-down movement of the AA curve in the diagram. Thus \\nthe final equilibrium is the same as the original equilibrium at point F. \\nRemember that in a fixed exchange rate system, IRP requires equalization of interest rates between \\ncountries.

Learn how currency crises develop and lead to capital flight. \\nTo maintain a credible fixed exchange rate system, a country will need to buy and sell the reserve currency \\nwhenever there is excess demand or supply in the private foreign exchange (Forex). To make sales of \\nforeign currency possible, a country will need to maintain a foreign exchange reserve. The reserve is a \\nstockpile of assets denominated in the reserve currency. For example, if the United States fixes the dollar \\nto the British pound, then it would need to have a reserve of pound assets in case it needs to intervene on \\nthe Forex with a sale of pounds. \\nGenerally, a central bank holds these reserves in the form of Treasury bonds issued by the reserve country \\ngovernment. In this way, the reserve holdings earn interest for the central bank and thus the reserves will \\ngrow in value over time. Holding reserves in the form of currency would not earn interest and thus are \\nless desirable. Nonetheless, a central bank will likely keep some of its reserves liquid in the form of \\ncurrency to make anticipated daily Forex transactions. If larger sales of reserves become necessary, the \\nU.S. central bank can always sell the foreign Treasury bonds on the bond market and convert those \\nholdings to currency. \\nA fixed exchange rate is sustainable if the country’s central bank can maintain that rate over time with \\nonly modest interventions in the Forex. Ideally, one would expect that during some periods of time, there \\nwould be excess demand for domestic currency on the Forex, putting pressure on the currency to \\nappreciate. In this case, the central bank would relieve the pressure by selling domestic currency and \\nbuying the reserve on the Forex, thus running a balance of payments (BoP) surplus. D uring these periods, \\nthe country’s reserve holdings would rise. At other periods, there may be excess demand for the reserve \\ncurrency, putting pressure on the domestic currency to depreciate. Here, the central bank would relieve \\nthe pressure by selling the reserve currency in exchange for domestic currency, thus running a balance of \\npayments deficit. During these periods, the country’s reserve holdings would fall. As long as the country’s \\nreserve holdings stay sufficiently high during its ups and downs, the  fixed exchange rate could be \\nmaintained indefinitely. In this way, the central bank’s interventions “smooth-out” the fluctuations that \\nwould have occurred in a floating system.

In this case, the central bank’s \\npersistent BoP deficits will move reserve holdings closer and closer to zero. A balance of payments crisis \\noccurs when the country is about to run out of foreign exchange reserves. \\nBorrowing Reserves \\nSeveral things may happen leading up to a balance of payments crisis. One option open to the central \\nbank is to borrow additional quantities of the reserve currency from the re serve country central bank, \\ngovernment, or an international institution like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF was \\noriginally created to help countries with balance of payments problems within the Bretton Woods fixed \\nexchange rate system (1945–1973). When a country was near to depleting its reserves, it could borrow \\nreserve currency from the IMF. As long as the balance of payments deficits leading to reserve depletion \\nwould soon be reversed with balance of payments surpluses, the country would be able to repay the loans \\nto the IMF in the near future. As such, the IMF “window” was intended to provide a safety valve in case \\nvolatility in supply and demand in the Forex was greater than a country’s reserve holdings could handle. \\nDevaluation \\nIf a country cannot acquire additional reserves and if it does not change domestic policies in a way that \\ncauses excess demand for foreign currency to cease or reverse, then the country will run out of foreign \\nreserves and will no longer be able to maintain a credible fixed exchange rate.

When the currency is devalued, the rate of return on foreign assets \\nmay fall, especially if investors had anticipated a devaluation and had adjusted their expectations \\naccordingly. (See the next section on capital flight for further discussion.) When the rate of return on \\nforeign assets falls, the demand for foreign currency will also fall. \\nIf the devaluation is large enough to reverse the currency demand in the Forex, generating excess demand \\nfor the domestic currency, the central bank will have to buy foreign reserves to maintain the new devalued \\nexchange rate and can begin to accumulate a stockpile of reserves once again.  \\nCapital Flight \\nBalance of payments crises are often anticipated by investors in the marketplace. When this occurs it will \\nresult in capital flight, which in turn is likely to aggravate the balance of payments crisis. Here’s why. \\nThe interest rate parity condition holds when rates of return on domestic and foreign assets are equalized. \\nRecall from Chapter 11 \"Fixed Exchange Rates\", Section 11.3 \"Interest Rate Parity with Fixed Exchange \\nRates\" that in a fixed exchange rate system the IRP condition simplifies to equalization of interest rates \\nbetween two countries. However, this result assumed that investors expected the currency to remain fixed \\nindefinitely. If investors believe instead that a country is about to suffer a balance of payments crisis and \\nrun out of foreign reserves, they will also anticipate that a devaluation will occur s oon. \\nAssume as before that the United States fixes its currency to the British pound. The interest rate parity \\ncondition can be written as \\n \\nwhere the left side is the rate of return on U.S. assets, equal to the average U.S. interest rate, and the right \\nside is the rate of return on British assets. When there is no imminent balance of payments crisis, \\ninvestors should expect the future exchange rate (E$/£e) to equal the current fixed exchange rate (E$/£) and \\nthe interest parity condition simplifies to i$ = i£. However, if investors recognize that the central bank is \\nselling large quantities of its foreign reserves in the Forex regularly, then they are likely also to recognize \\nthat the balance of payments deficits are unsustainable. Once the reserves run out,  the central bank will \\nbe forced to devalue its currency. Thus forward-looking investors should plan for that event today.

Now, RoR£ > RoR$, and investors will increase demand for British pounds on the Forex. In \\nthis instance, investors are “fleeing” their own domestic assets to purchase foreign assets (or capital) that \\nnow have a greater expected return. Thus the action is called capital flight. \\nThe intuition for capital flight is simple. If an investor expects the domestic currency (a nd assets \\ndenominated in that currency) will soon fall in value, it is better to sell now before the value actually does \\nfall. Also, as the domestic currency falls in value, the British pound is expected to rise in value. Thus it is \\nwise to buy British pounds and assets while their prices are lower and profit on the increase in the pound \\nvalue when the dollar devaluation occurs. \\nThe broader effect of capital flight, which occurs in anticipation of a balance of payments crisis, is that it \\ncan actually force a crisis to occur much sooner. Suppose the United States was indeed running low on \\nforeign reserves after running successive balance of payments deficits. Once investors surmise that a crisis \\nmay be possible soon and react with a change in their expected exchange rate, there will be a resulting \\nincrease in demand for pounds on the Forex. This will force the central bank to intervene even further in \\nthe Forex by selling foreign pound reserves to satisfy investor demand and to keep the exchange rate \\nfixed. However, additional interventions imply an even faster depletion of foreign reserve holdings, \\nbringing the date of crisis closer in time. \\nIt is even possible for investor behavior to create a balance of payments crisis when one might not have \\noccurred otherwise. Suppose the U.S. central bank (or the Fed) depletes reserves by running balance of \\npayments deficits. However, suppose the Fed believes the reserve holdings remain adequate to defend the \\ncurrency value, whereas investors believe the reserve holdings are inadequate. In this case, capital flight \\nwill likely occur that would deplete reserves much faster than before. If the capital flight is large enough, \\neven if it is completely unwarranted based on market conditions, it could nonetheless deplete the \\nremaining reserves and force the central bank to devalue the currency.  \\nReturn to Float \\nThere is one other possible response for a country suffering from a balance of payments crisis.

Learn how the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates set up after World War II was \\nsupposed to work. \\n2. Learn how and why the system collapsed in 1973. \\n3. Recognize some of the problems inherent in one type of fixed exchange rate system. \\nIn July 1944, delegates from forty-five of the allied powers engaged in World War II met in Bretton \\nWoods, New Hampshire, in the United States to plan for the economic institutions believed necessary to \\nassist in the reconstruction, development, and growth of the postwar economy. Foremost on the delegates’ \\nminds was the instability of the international economic system after World War I, including the \\nexperiences of hyperinflation as in Germany in 1922–1923 and the worldwide depression of the 1930s. \\nOne element believed necessary to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past was to implement a system of \\nfixed exchange rates. Not only could fixed exchange rates help prevent inflation, but they could also \\neliminate uncertainties in international transactions and thus serve to promote the expansion of \\ninternational trade and investment. It was further hoped that economic interconnectedness would make it \\nmore difficult for nationalism to reassert itself. \\nThe Bretton Woods system of exchange rates was set up as a gold exchange standard, a cross between a \\npure gold standard and a reserve currency standard. In a gold exchange standard, one country is singled \\nout to be the reserve currency. In the Bretton Woods case, the currency was the U.S. dollar. The U.S. \\ndollar was fixed to a weight in gold, originally set at $35 per ounce. The U.S. central bank agreed to \\nexchange dollars for gold on demand, but only with foreign central banks. In a pure gold standard, the \\ncentral bank would exchange gold for dollars with the general public as well.  \\nThe nonreserve countries agreed to fix their currencies to the U.S. dollar or to gold.  [1]However, there was \\nno obligation on the part of the nonreserve countries to exchange their currencies for gold. Only the \\nreserve country had that obligation. Instead, the nonreserve-currency countries were obliged to maintain \\nthe fixed exchange rate to the U.S. dollar by intervening on the foreign exchange (Forex) market and \\nbuying or selling dollars as necessary.

Thus for all nonreserve countries the Bretton Woods system functioned like a reserve \\ncurrency standard. \\nOne of the problems that typically arises with a reserve currency standard is the persistence of balance of \\npayments (BoP) deficits. BoP deficits require a country to sell its dollar reserves on the Forex market. \\nWhen these deficits are recurring and large, a country will eventually run out of reserves. When that \\nhappens, it will no longer be able to defend its fixed currency value. The likely outcome would be a \\ndevaluation, an action that runs counter to the goals of the system, namely to maintain exchange rate \\nstability and to ward off inflationary tendencies. \\nTo provide a safety valve for countries that may face this predicament, the International Monetary Fund \\n(IMF) was established to provide temporary loans to countries to help maintain their fixed exchange \\nrates. Each member country was required to maintain a quota of reserves with the IMF that would then be \\navailable to lend to those countries experiencing balance of payments difficulties.  \\nToday the IMF maintains the same quota system and member countries enjoy the same privilege to \\nborrow even though many are no longer maintaining a fixed exchange rate. Instead , many countries \\nborrow from the IMF when they become unable to maintain payments on international debts. Go to \\nthe IMF Factsheet for more information about the current quota system. [2] \\nThe Bretton Woods exchange rate system was an imperfect system that suffered under many strains \\nduring its history. Nonetheless, it did achieve fixed exchange rates among its members for almost thirty \\nyears. For a more detailed, though brief, account of the history of the system, see Benjamin Cohen’s \\narticle. [3] \\nWe can learn much about the intended workings of the system by studying the system’s collapse. The \\ncollapse occurred mostly because the United States would not allow its internal domestic policies to be \\ncompromised for the sake of the fixed exchange rate system.

This put pressure on the U.S. dollar to depreciate and nonreserve \\ncurrencies to appreciate. To maintain the fixed exchange rate, nonreserve countries were required to \\nintervene on the private Forex. For example, the British central bank was required to run a balance of \\npayments surplus, buy the excess dollars, and sell pounds on the private Forex market. \\nAs was shown in Chapter 12 \"Policy Effects with Fixed Exchange Rates\", Section 12.6 \"Currency Crises and \\nCapital Flight\", persistent balance of payments surpluses do not pose a long-term problem in the same \\nway as BoP deficits. The British central bank had an unlimited capacity to “print” as many pounds as \\nnecessary to buy the oversupplied dollars on the Forex. However, persistently large BoP surpluses will \\nresult in an ever-increasing British money supply that will lead to inflationary effects eventually. \\nIndeed, U.S. inflation was rising, especially in the late 1960s. Federal government spending was rising \\nquickly— first, to finance the Vietnam War, and second, to finance new social spending arising out of \\nPresident Johnson’s Great Society initiatives. Rather than increasing taxes to finance the added expenses, \\nthe United States resorted to expansionary monetary policy, effectively printing money to finance growing \\ngovernment budget deficits. This is also called “monetizing the debt.” \\nThe immediate financial impact of a rising U.S. money supply was lower U.S. interest rates, leading to \\nextra demand for foreign currency by investors to take advantage of the higher relative rates of return \\noutside the United States. The longer-term impact of a rising U.S. money supply was inflation. As U.S. \\nprices rose, U.S. goods became relatively more expensive relative to foreign goods, also leading to extra \\ndemand for foreign currency. \\nA look at the statistics of the 1960s belies this story of excessive monetary expansion and fiscal \\nimprudence. Between 1959 and 1970, U.S. money supply growth and U.S. inflation were lower than in \\nevery other G-7 country. U.S. government budget deficits were also not excessively large.

Thus the German, British, French, Japanese, et al., central banks bought up \\ndollars in great quantities and at the same time continually increased their own domestic money supplies.  \\nOne effect of the continual balance of payments surpluses was a subsequent increase in inflation caused \\nby rising money supplies in the nonreserve countries. In effect, expansionary monetary policy  in the \\nUnited States, and its inflationary consequences, are exported to the nonreserve countries by virtue of the \\nfixed exchange rate system. This effect was not welcomed by the nonreserve countries like Britain, France, \\nand Germany. \\nA second effect of the continual balance of payments surpluses was a rising stock of dollar reserves. \\nNonreserve central banks held those reserves in the form of U.S. Treasury bills; thus, increasingly, U.S. \\ngovernment debt was held by foreign countries. \\nAlthough such BoP surpluses could technically continue indefinitely, the inflationary consequences in \\nEurope and Japan and the rising dollar holdings abroad put the sustainability of the system into question. \\nIdeally in a fixed exchange system, BoP surpluses will be offset wit h comparable BoP deficits over time, if \\nthe exchange rate is fixed at an appropriate (i.e., sustainable) level. Continual BoP surpluses, however, \\nindicate that the sustainable exchange rate should be at a much lower U.S. dollar value if the surpluses are \\nto be eliminated. Recognition of this leads observers to begin to expect a dollar devaluation.  \\nIf (or when) a dollar devaluation occurred, dollar asset holdings by foreigners — including the U.S. \\ngovernment Treasury bills comprising the reserves held by foreign central banks— would suddenly fall in \\nvalue. In other words, foreign asset holders would lose a substantial amount of money if the dollar were \\ndevalued. \\nFor private dollar investors there was an obvious response to this potential scenario: divest of doll ar \\nassets— that is, sell dollars and convert to pounds, deutschmarks, or francs. This response in the late \\n1960s and early 1970s contributed to the capital flight from the U.S. dollar, put added downward pressure \\non the U.S. dollar value, and led to even greater BoP surpluses by nonreserve central banks. \\nThe nonreserve central banks, on the other hand, could not simply convert dollars to pounds or francs, as \\nthis would add to the pressure for a depreciating dollar. Further, it was their dollar purchases that were \\npreventing the dollar depreciation from happening in the first place. \\nDuring the 1960 and early 1970s the amount of U.S. dollar reserves held by nonreserve central banks grew \\nsignificantly, which led to what became known as theTriffin dilemma (dollar overhang).

Dollar overhang occurred when the amount of U.S. dollar assets held by nonreserve central \\nbanks exceeded the total supply of gold in the U.S. Treasury at the exchange rate of $35 per ounce. Dollar \\noverhang occurred in the system by 1960 and continued to worsen throughout the decade of the 1960s. By \\n1971 foreign holdings of U.S. dollars stood at $50 billion while U.S. gold reserves were valued at only $15 \\nbillion. [7] \\nUnder the Bretton Woods system, foreign central banks were allowed to exchange their dollars for gold at \\nthe rate of $35 per ounce. Once the dollar overhang problem arose, it became conceivable that the United \\nStates could run out of its reserve asset— gold. Thus the potential for this type of BoP deficit could lead to \\nspeculation that the U.S. dollar would have to be devalued at some point in the future.  \\nNow, if one expects the dollar will fall in value at some future date, then it would make sense to convert \\nthose dollars to something that may hold its value better; gold was the alternative asset. Throughout the \\n1950s and 1960s, foreign central banks did convert some of their dollar holdings to gold, but  not all. In \\n1948, the United States held over 67 percent of the world’s monetary gold reserves. By 1970, however, the \\nU.S. gold holdings had fallen to just 16 percent of the world total.  [8] In a gold exchange standard, the \\nlinkage between gold and the reserve currency is supposed to provide the constraint that prevents the \\nreserve currency country from excessive monetary expansion and its subsequent inflationary effects. \\nHowever, in the face of BoP deficits leading to a severe depletion of gold reserves, the United States had \\nseveral adjustment options open. \\nOne option was a devaluation of the dollar. However, this option was not easy to implement. The U.S. \\ndollar could not be devalued with respect to the pound, the franc, or the yen since the United State s did \\nnot fix its currency to them. (Recall that the other countries were fixed to the dollar.) Thus the only way to \\nrealize this type of dollar devaluation was for the other countries to “revalue” their currencies with respect \\nto the dollar. The other “devaluation” option open to the United States was devaluation with respect to \\ngold. In other words, the United States could raise the price of gold to $40 or $50 per ounce or more. \\nHowever, this change would not change the fundamental conditions that led to the excess supply of \\ndollars. At most, this devaluation would only reduce the rate at which gold flowed out to foreign central \\nbanks.

Recall that money supply increases were high to help finance rising federal \\ndeficit spending. A reversal of this policy would mean a substantial reduction in the growth of the money \\nsupply. If money supply increases were not available to finance the budget deficit, the government would \\nhave to resort to a much more unpopular method of financing— that is, raising taxes or reducing spending. \\nThe unpopularity and internal difficulty of such fiscal and monetary prudence led the United States to \\nresort to other options. One suggestion made repeatedly by the United States was that the nonreserve \\ncountries should “revalue” their currencies to the dollar. However, their response was that the \\nfundamental problem was not their fault; therefore, they shouldn’t be the ones to implement a solution. \\nInstead, it was the United States that needed to change. \\nBy the spring of 1971, the imbalances in the system reached crisis proportions. In April 1971, the \\nBundesbank (Germany’s central bank) purchased over $3 billion to maintain the fixed exchange rate. In \\nearly May, it bought over $2 billion in just two days to maintain the rate. Fearing inflation after such huge \\npurchases, Germany decided to let its currency float to a new value, 8 percent higher than its previous \\nfixed rate. Austria, Holland, and Switzerland quickly followed suit. [9] Despite these revaluations, they \\nwere insufficient to stem the excess supply of dollars on the Forex. By August 1971, another major \\nrealignment seemed inevitable that substantially increased the pace of dolla r capital flight. On August 15, \\n1971, President Nixon announced a bold plan for readjustment. The plan had three main aspects:  \\n1. A 10 percent import surcharge on all imports was implemented. This tariff would remain in effect until a \\nnew international monetary order was negotiated. \\n2. Suspension of dollar convertibility into gold. Foreign central banks would no longer have the option to \\nexchange dollars for gold with the U.S. central bank. \\n3. Wage and price controls were implemented to stem the rising U.S. inflatio n \\nThe import surcharge meant that an extra 10 percent would be assessed over the existing import tariff. \\nThis was implemented to force other countries to the bargaining table where, presumably, they would \\nagree to a multilateral revaluation of their currencies to the dollar.

The 10 percent import tax effectively raised the prices of foreign goods in U.S. \\nmarkets and would have a similar effect as a 10 percent currency revaluation. The expectation was that \\nthe average revaluation necessary to bring the system into balance would be somewhat less than 10 \\npercent, thus an 8 percent revaluation, say, would be less painful to exporters than a 10 percent import \\ntax. \\nThe suspension of dollar-gold convertibility was really the more significant change as it effectively ended \\nthe gold exchange standard and marked the death of the Bretton Woods system. With no obl igation to \\nexchange gold for dollars, the system essentially was changed to a reserve currency system. Previous \\nconstraints on the United States, caused when it runs a BoP deficit and loses gold reserves, were thus \\neliminated. There was no longer a possibility that the United States could run out of gold. \\nThe wage and price controls, implemented for a ninety-day period, put added pressure on foreign \\nexporters. Being forced to pay a 10 percent surcharge but not being allowed to raise prices meant they \\nwould not be allowed to push the tax increase onto consumers.  \\nThese three measures together resulted in a rapid renegotiation of the Bretton Woods system, culminating \\nin the Smithsonian Agreement in December 1971. In this agreement, the nonreserve countries accepted an \\naverage 8 percent revaluation of their currencies to the dollar in return for the elimination of the import \\nsurcharge. They also enlarged the currency bands around the par values from 1 percent to 2.25 percent. By \\nvirtue of the revaluations, the dollar naturally became “devalued.” The United States also devalued dollars \\nwith respect to gold, raising the price to $38 per ounce. However, since the United States did not agree to \\nreopen the gold window, the change in the price of gold was meaningles s. \\nMore important, since the United States no longer needed to be concerned about a complete loss of gold \\nreserves, the dollar overhang problem was “solved,” and it was free to continue its monetary growth and \\ninflationary policies. During the following year, the United States did just that; within a short time, there \\narose renewed pressure for the dollar to depreciate from its new par values.  \\nIn the end, the Smithsonian Agreement extended the life of Bretton Woods for just over a year. By March \\n1973, a repeat of the severe dollar outflows in 1971 led to a suspension of Forex trading for almost three \\nweeks.

Once stability to the exchange rates was restored, a new fixed exchange rate \\nsystem could be implemented. However, despite negotiations, an agreement was never reached, and a \\nunified international system of fixed exchange rates has never since been tried.  \\nHow Bretton Woods Was Supposed to Work \\nIn theory, a gold-exchange standard can work to provide exchange rate stability and reduce inflationary \\ntendencies. However, it will only work if the reserve currency country maintains prudent monetary \\npolicies and if countries follow the rules of the system. \\nFor the nonreserve countries, their task was to avoid balance of payments deficits. These deficits would \\narise if they pursued excessive expansionary monetary policy. The lower interest rates and eventual \\ninflation would lead to capital flight, creating pressure for the currency to depreciate. To avoid a \\ndevaluation, and hence to follow the fixity rule, the nonreserve country would have to contract its money \\nsupply to take pressure off its currency and to reverse the BoP deficits.  \\nThe problem that usually arises here is that contractionary monetary policies will raise interest rates and \\neliminate an important source of government budget financing, namely debt monetization (printing \\nmoney). These changes are likely to result in an increase in taxes, a decrease in government spending, a \\ncontraction of the economy, and a loss of jobs. Thus following the rules of the system wi ll sometimes be \\npainful. \\nHowever, this was not the source of the Bretton Woods collapse. Instead, it was excessive monetary \\nexpansion by the reserve country, the United States. In this case, when the United States expanded its \\nmoney supply, to finance budget deficits, it caused lower U.S. interest rates and had inflationary \\nconsequences. This led to increased demand for foreign currency by investors and traders. However, the \\nUnited States was not obligated to intervene to maintain the fixed exchange rates s ince the United States \\nwas not fixing to anyone. Rather, it was the obligation of the nonreserve countries to intervene, buy \\ndollars, sell their own currencies, and consequently run BoP surpluses. These surpluses resulted in the \\ngrowing stock of dollar reserves abroad. \\nHowever, if the system had worked properly, foreign central banks would have cashed in their dollar \\nassets for gold reserves long before the dollar overhang problem arose.

Of course, this choice will likely have negative longer-term consequences.

Preview the discussion about fixed versus floating exchange rate systems. \\nThis chapter addresses what is perhaps the most important policy issue in international finance: to have \\nfixed or floating exchange rates. The chapter focuses on three main features that affect the choice of \\nsystem: volatility and risk, inflationary consequences, and monetary autonomy.  \\nVolatility and risk refers to the tendency for exchange rates to change and the effect these changes have on \\nthe risk faced by traders and investors. Although in floating exchange systems volatility is a natural day-\\nto-day occurrence, even in fixed exchange systems, devaluations or revaluations make volatility an issue. \\nThis chapter compares the two systems in light of this issue. \\nInflationary consequences are shown to be a major potential problem for countries with floating exchange \\nrates. For many countries facing this problem, fixed exchange rate systems can provide relief. The section \\nshows that the relationship between inflation and the exchange rate system is an important element in the \\nchoice of system. \\nFinally, monetary autonomy, and the ability to control the economy, is lost with the choice of fixed \\nexchange rates. We discuss why this loss of autonomy can be problematic in some circumstances but not \\nin others. \\nThe chapter concludes by providing some answers to the policy question, “fixed or floating?” \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Three main features affect the choice of the exchange rate system: volatility and risk, inflationary \\nconsequences, and monetary autonomy. \\n• The choice between fixed and floating exchange rates is one of the most important policy \\ndecisions in international finance. \\nEXERCISE  \\n1.

Learn how exchange rate volatility raises risk for international traders and investors. \\nProbably the most important characteristic of alternative exchange rate systems is the feature used to \\ndescribe them, namely fixed or floating. Fixed exchange rates, by definition, are not supposed to change. \\nThey are meant to remain fixed, preferably permanently. Floating rates float up and down and down and \\nup from year to year, week to week, and minute by minute. What a floating exchange rate will be a year \\nfrom now, or even a week from now, is often very difficult to predict.  \\nVolatility represents the degree to which a variable changes over time. The larger the magnitude of a \\nvariable change, or the more quickly it changes over time, the more volatile it is.  \\nSince fixed exchange rates are not supposed to change— by definition— they have no volatility. Please note \\nthe cautious wording because fixed exchange rates are quite frequently devalued or revalued, implying \\nthat they can and do indeed change. However, we will explore this issue in more detail later. A floating \\nexchange rate may or may not be volatile depending on how much it changes over time. However, since \\nfloating exchange rates are free to change, they are usually expected to be more volatile.  \\nVolatile exchange rates make international trade and investment decisions more difficult because \\nvolatility increases exchange rate risk. Exchange rate risk refers to the potential to lose money because of \\na change in the exchange rate. Below are two quick examples of how traders and investors may lose \\nmoney when the exchange rate changes. \\nExchange Rate Risk for Traders \\nFirst consider a business that imports soccer balls into the United States. Suppose one thousand soccer \\nballs purchased from a supplier in Pakistan costs 300,000 Pakistani rupees. At the current exchange rate \\nof 60 Rs/$, it will cost the importer $5,000 dollars or $5 per soccer ball. The importer det ermines that \\ntransportation, insurance, advertising, and retail costs will run about $5 per soccer ball. If the competitive \\nmarket price for this type of soccer ball is $12, he will make a $2 profit per ball if all balls are sold.  \\nSuppose the shipment is scheduled to occur in three months and that payment for the shipment need not \\nbe made until that time. Let’s assume the importer waits to convert currency until the payment is made \\nand that in three months’ time the Pakistani rupee has appreciated to a new value of 55 Rs/$. The \\nshipment cost in rupees remains the same at Rs 300,000, but the dollar value of the shipment rises to ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Assuming the same $5 of extra costs and a $12 final sale price, the \\nimporter will now make only $1.45 profit per soccer ball, if all balls are sold. While this is still a profit, it is \\nabout 25 percent less than expected when the decision to purchase was made three months before.  \\nThis is an example of the risk an importer faces because of a change in the currency value. Of course, it is \\ntrue that the currency value could have changed in the opposite direction. Had the rupee value risen to 65 \\nRs/$, the shipment value would have cost just $4,615, or $4.62 per ball, generating a profit of $2.38 per \\nsoccer ball. In this case, the currency moves in the importer’s favor. Thus a volatile exchange rate will \\nsometimes lead to greater losses than expected, and at other times, to greater gains.  \\nThere are several methods to protect oneself from this type of currency risk. The importer could have \\nexchanged currency at the time the deal was struck and held his 300,000 rupees in a Pakistani bank until \\npayment is made. However, this involves a substantial additional opportunity cost since the funds must be \\navailable beforehand and become unusable while they are held in a Pakistani bank account. Alternatively, \\nthe importer may be able to find a bank willing to write a forward exchange contract, fixing an exchange \\nrate today for an exchange to be made three months from now.  \\nIn any case, it should be clear that exchange rate fluctuations either increase the risk of losses relative to \\nplans or increase the costs to protect against those risks. \\nExchange Rate Risk for Investors \\nVolatile exchange rates also create exchange rate risk for international investors. Consider the following \\nexample. Suppose in October 2004, a U.S. resident decides to invest (i.e., save) $10,000 for the next year. \\nGiven that the U.S. dollar had been weakening with respect to the Danish krone for several years and \\nsince the interest rate on a money market deposit was slightly higher in Denmark at 2.25 percent \\ncompared to the 1.90 percent return in the United States, the investor decides to put the $10,000 into the \\nDanish account. At the time of the deposit, the exchange rate sits at 5.90 kr/$. In October 2005, the \\ndepositor cashes in and converts the money back to U.S. dollars. The exchange rate in October 2005 was \\n6.23 kr/$. To determine the return on the investment we can apply the rate of return formula de rived \\nin Chapter 4 \"Foreign Exchange Markets and Rates of Return\", Section 4.3 \"Calculating Rate of Returns \\non International Investments\" and Chapter 4 \"Foreign Exchange Markets and Rates of Return\", Section \\n4.4 \"Interpretation of the Rate of Return Formula\": ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Had he deposited the $10,000 in a U.S. account, he would have \\nhad a guaranteed return of 1.90 percent, earning him $190 instead. \\nBy depositing in a foreign account, the depositor subjected himself to exchange rate risk. The dollar \\nunexpectedly appreciated during the year, resulting in a loss. Had the dollar remain fixed in value during \\nthat same time, the foreign return would have been 2.25 percent, which is larger than that obtained in the \\nUnited States. \\nThus fluctuating exchange rates make it more difficult for investors to know the best place to invest. One \\ncannot merely look at what the interest rate is across countries but must also speculate about the \\nexchange rate change. Make the wrong guess about the exchange rate movement and one could lose a \\nsubstantial amount of money. \\nThere are some ways to hedge against exchange rate risk. For example, with short -term deposits, an \\ninvestor can purchase a forward contract or enter a futures market. In these cases, the investor would \\narrange to sell Danish krone in the future when the deposit is expected to be converted back to dollars. \\nSince the future exchange rate is predetermined on such a contract, the rate of return is guaranteed as \\nwell. Thus the risk of floating exchange rates can be reduced. However, for long -term investment such as \\nforeign direct investment, these types of arrangements are more difficult and  costly to implement. \\nVolatility and the Choice of Exchange Rate System \\nOn the face of it, floating exchange rates would appear to be riskier than fixed rates since they are free to \\nchange regularly.

A 2004 International \\nMonetary Fund (IMF) study [1] notes that on average, during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the volatility of \\nfixed exchange rates was approximately the same as that of floating rates. There are two reasons this can \\noccur. First, a currency fixed to another reserve currency will continue to float against other currencies.  \\nThus when China pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar, it continued to float with the dollar vis -à-vis the \\neuro. Second, it is common for fixed currencies to be devalued or revalued periodically, sometimes \\ndramatically. When this happens, the effects of volatility are concentrated in a very short time frame and \\ncan have much larger economic impacts. \\nThe second thing noted by this study is that volatility had only a small effect on bilateral international \\ntrade flows, suggesting that the choice of exchange rate system on trade flows may be insignificant. \\nHowever, the study does not consider the effects of volatility on international investment decisions. Other \\nstudies do show a negative relationship between exchange rate volatility and foreign direct invest ment. \\nBut if these results were true and fixed exchange rates are just as volatile as floating rates, then there is no \\nobvious exchange system “winner” in terms of the effects on volatility. Nevertheless, volatility of exchange \\nrate systems remains something to worry about and consider in the choice of exchange rate systems.  \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• Volatile exchange rates make international trade and investment decisions more difficult \\nbecause volatility increases exchange rate risk. \\n• Volatile exchange rates can quickly and significantly change the expected rates of return on \\ninternational investments. \\n• Volatile exchange rates can quickly and significantly change the profitability of importing and \\nexporting. \\n• Despite the expectation that fixed exchange rates are less volatile, a 2004 IMF study notes that \\non average, during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the volatility of fixed exchange rates was \\napproximately the same as that of floating rates. \\nEXERCISES  \\n1.

Learn how a fixed exchange rate system can be used to reduce inflation. \\nOne important reason to choose a system of fixed exchange rates is to try to dampen inflationary \\ntendencies. Many countries have (over time) experienced the following kind of situation. The government \\nfaces pressure from constituents to increase spending and raise transfer payments, which it does. \\nHowever, it does not finance these expenditure increases with higher taxes since this is very unpopular. \\nThis leads to a sizeable budget deficit that can grow over time. When the deficits grow sufficiently large, \\nthe government may become unable to borrow additional money without raising the interest rate on \\nbonds to unacceptably high levels. An easy way out of this fiscal dilemma is to finance the public defici ts \\nwith purchases of bonds by the country’s central bank. In this instance, a country will be financing the \\nbudget deficit by monetizing the debt, also known as printing money. New money means an increase in \\nthe domestic money supply, which will have two effects. \\nThe short-term effect will be to lower interest rates. With free capital mobility, a reduction in interest \\nrates will make foreign deposits relatively more attractive to investors and there is likely to be an increase \\nin supply of domestic currency on the foreign exchange market. If floating exchange rates are in place, the \\ndomestic currency will depreciate with respect to other currencies. The long -term effect of the money \\nsupply increase will be inflation, if the gross domestic product (GDP) growt h does not rise fast enough to \\nkeep up with the increase in money. Thus we often see countries experiencing a rapidly depreciating \\ncurrency together with a rapid inflation rate. A good example of this trend was seen in Turkey during the \\n1980s and 1990s. \\nOne effective way to reduce or eliminate this inflationary tendency is to fix one’s currency. A fixed \\nexchange rate acts as a constraint that prevents the domestic money supply from rising too rapidly. Here’s \\nhow it works. \\nSuppose a country fixes its currency to another country— a reserve country. Next, imagine that the same \\ncircumstances from the story above begin to occur. Rising budget deficits lead to central bank financing, \\nwhich increases the money supply of the country. As the money supply rises, intere st rates decrease and \\ninvestors begin to move savings abroad, and so there is an increase in supply of the domestic currency on \\nthe foreign exchange market.

This means that the increase in supply of domestic currency by private \\ninvestors will be purchased by the central bank to balance supply and demand at the fixed exchange rate. \\nThe central bank will be running a balance of payments deficit in this case, which will result in a reduction \\nin the domestic money supply. \\nThis means that as the central bank prints money to finance the budget deficit, it will simultaneously need \\nto run a balance of payments deficit, which will soak up domestic money. The net effect on the money \\nsupply should be such as to maintain the fixed exchange rate with the money supply rising proportionate \\nto the rate of growth in the economy. If the latter is true, there will be little to no inflation occurring. Thus \\na fixed exchange rate system can eliminate inflationary tendencies.  \\nOf course, for the fixed exchange rate to be effective in reducing inflation over a long period, it will be \\nnecessary that the country avoid devaluations. Devaluations occur because the central bank runs \\npersistent balance of payments deficits and is about to run out of foreign exchange reserves. Once the \\ndevaluation occurs, the country will be able to support a much higher level of money supply that in turn \\nwill have a positive influence on the inflation rate. If devaluations occur frequently, then it is almost as if \\nthe country is on a floating exchange rate system in which case there is no effective constraint on the \\nmoney supply and inflation can again get out of control. \\nTo make the fixed exchange rate system more credible and to prevent regular devaluation, countries will \\nsometime use a currency board arrangement. With a currency board, there is no central bank with \\ndiscretion over policy. Instead, the country legislates an automatic exchange rate inter vention mechanism \\nthat forces the fixed exchange rate to be maintained. \\nFor even more credibility, countries such as Ecuador and El Salvador have dollarized their currencies. In \\nthese cases, the country simply uses the other country’s currency as its legal tender and there is no longer \\nany ability to print money or let one’s money supply get out of control. \\nHowever, in other circumstances fixed exchange rates have resulted in more, rather than less, inflation. In \\nthe late 1960s and early 1970s, much of the developed world was under the Bretton Woods system of fixed \\nexchange rates. The reserve currency was the U.S. dollar, meaning that all other countries fixed their \\ncurrency value to the U.S. dollar. When rapid increases in the U.S. money supply led to a sur ge of inflation \\nin the United States, the other nonreserve countries like Britain, Germany, France, and Japan were forced \\nto run balance of payments surpluses to maintain their fixed exchange rates.

Thus, in essence, U.S. \\ninflation was exported to many other countries because of the fixed exchange rate system.  \\nThe lesson from these stories is that sometimes fixed exchange rates tend to lower inflation while at other \\ntimes they tend to increase it. The key is to fix your currency to something that is not likely to rise in value \\n(inflate) too quickly. In the 1980 and 1990s, when the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) was in \\nplace, countries were in practice fixed to the German deutschmark. Since the German central bank was \\nprobably the least prone to inflationary tendencies, all other European countries were able to bring their \\ninflation rates down substantially due to the ERM system. However, had th e countries fixed to the Italian \\nlira, inflation may have been much more rapid throughout Europe over the two decades.  \\nMany people propose a return to the gold standard precisely because it fixes a currency to something that \\nis presumed to be steadier in value over time. Under a gold standard, inflation would be tied to the \\nincrease in monetary gold stocks. Because gold is strictly limited in physical quantity, only a limited \\namount can be discovered and added to gold stocks each year, Thus inflation may be  adequately \\nconstrained. But because of other problems with a return to gold as the monetary support, a return to this \\ntype of system seems unlikely. \\nKEY TAKEAWAYS  \\n• A fixed exchange rate can act as a constraint to prevent the domestic money supply from rising \\ntoo rapidly (i.e., if the reserve currency country has noninflationary monetary policies). \\n• Adoption of a foreign country’s currency as your own is perhaps the most credible method of \\nfixing the exchange rate. \\n• Sometimes, as in the Bretton Woods system, a fixed exchange rate system leads to more \\ninflation. This occurs if the reserve currency country engages in excessively expansionary \\nmonetary policy. \\n• A gold standard is sometimes advocated precisely because it fixes a currency to something (i.e., \\ngold) that is presumed to be more steady in value over time. \\nEXERCISE  \\n1.

Learn how floating and fixed exchange rate systems compare with respect to monetary \\nautonomy. \\nMonetary autonomy refers to the independence of a country’s central bank to affect its own money supply \\nand conditions in its domestic economy. In a floating exchange rate system, a central bank is free to \\ncontrol the money supply. It can raise the money supply when it wishes to lower domestic interest rates to \\nspur investment and economic growth. By doing so it may also be able to reduce a rising unemployment \\nrate. Alternatively, it can lower the money supply, to raise interest rates and to try to choke off excessive \\ngrowth and a rising inflation rate. With monetary autonomy, monetary policy is an available tool the \\ngovernment can use to control the performance of the domestic economy. This offers a second lever of \\ncontrol, beyond fiscal policy. \\nIn a fixed exchange rate system, monetary policy becomes ineffective because the fixity of the exchange \\nrate acts as a constraint. As shown in Chapter 12 \"Policy Effects with Fixed Exchange Rates\", Section 12.2 \\n\"Monetary Policy with Fixed Exchange Rates\", when the money supply is raised, it will lower domestic \\ninterest rates and make foreign assets temporarily more attractive. This will lead domestic investors to \\nraise demand for foreign currency that would result in a depreciation of the domestic currency, if a \\nfloating exchange rate were allowed. However, with a fixed exchange rate in place, the extra demand for \\nforeign currency will need to be supplied by the central bank, which will run a balance of payments deficit \\nand buy up its own domestic currency. The purchases of domestic currency in the second stage will \\nperfectly offset the increase in money in the first stage, so that no increase in money supply will take \\nplace. \\nThus the requirement to keep the exchange rate fixed constrains the central bank from using monetary \\npolicy to control the economy.

A crawling peg, \\nin which exchange rates are adjusted regularly, is one example. Another is to fix the exchange rate within \\na band. In this case, the central bank will have the ability to control the money supply, up or down, within \\na small range, but will not be free to make large adjustments without breaching the band limits on the \\nexchange rate. These types of systems provide an intermediate degree of autonomy for the central bank.  \\nIf we ask which is better, monetary autonomy or a lack of autonomy, the answer is mixed. In some \\nsituations, countries need, or prefer, to have monetary autonomy. In other cases, it is downright \\ndangerous for a central bank to have autonomy. The determining factor is whether the central bank can \\nmaintain prudent monetary policies. If the central bank can control money supply growth such that it has \\nonly moderate inflationary tendencies, then monetary autonomy can work well for a country. However, if \\nthe central bank cannot control money supply growth, and if high inflation is a regular occurrence, then \\nmonetary autonomy is not a blessing. \\nOne of the reasons Britain has decided not to join the eurozone is because it wants to maintain its \\nmonetary autonomy. By joining the eurozone, Britain would give up its central bank’s ability to control its \\ndomestic money supply since euros would circulate instead of British pounds . The amount of euros in \\ncirculation is determined by the European Central Bank (ECB). Although Britain would have some input \\ninto money supply determinations, it would clearly have much less influence than it would for its own \\ncurrency. The decisions of the ECB would also reflect the more general concerns of the entire eurozone \\nrather than simply what might be best for Britain. For example, if there are regional disparities in \\neconomic growth (e.g., Germany, France, etc., are growing rapidly, while Britain  is growing much more \\nslowly), the ECB may decide to maintain a slower money growth policy to satisfy the larger demands to \\nslow growth and subsequent inflation in the continental countries. The best policy for Britain alone, \\nhowever, might be a more rapid increase in money supply to help stimulate its growth. If Britain remains \\noutside the eurozone, it remains free to determine the monetary policies it deems best for itself. If it joins \\nthe eurozone, it loses its monetary autonomy. \\nIn contrast, Argentina suffered severe hyperinflations during the 1970s and 1980s.

In this case, monetary autonomy was a curse, not a blessing.  \\nIn an attempt to restrain the growth of the money supply, Argentina imposed a currency board in 1992. A \\ncurrency board is a method of fixing one’s exchange rate with a higher degree of credibility.

As a result, it loses the ability to use monetary policy to control outcomes in its \\ndomestic economy. \\n• In a floating exchange rate system, a country can adjust its money supply and interest rates \\nfreely and thus can use monetary policy to control outcomes in its domestic economy. \\n• If the central bank can control money supply growth such that it has only moderate inflationary \\ntendencies, then monetary autonomy (floating) can work well for a country. However, if the \\ncentral bank cannot control money supply growth, and if high inflation is a regular occurrence, \\nthen monetary autonomy (floating) will not help the country. \\nEXERCISE  \\n1.

Learn the pros and cons of both floating and fixed exchange rate systems. \\nThe exchange rate is one of the key international aggregate variables studied in an international finance \\ncourse. It follows that the choice of exchange rate system is one of the key policy questions.  \\nCountries have been experimenting with different international payment and exchange systems for a very \\nlong time. In early history, all trade was barter exchange, meaning goods were traded for other goods. \\nEventually, especially scarce or precious commodities, for example gold and silver, were used as  a \\nmedium of exchange and a method for storing value. This practice evolved into the metal standards that \\nprevailed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. By default, since gold and silver standards \\nimply fixed exchange rates between countries, early experience with international monetary systems was \\nexclusively with fixed systems. Fifty years ago, international textbooks dealt almost entirely with \\ninternational adjustments under a fixed exchange rate system since the world had had few experiences  \\nwith floating rates. \\nThat experience changed dramatically in 1973 with the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate \\nsystem. At that time, most of the major developed economies allowed their currencies to float freely, with \\nexchange values being determined in a private market based on supply and demand, rather than by \\ngovernment decree. Although when Bretton Woods collapsed, the participating countries intended to \\nresurrect a new improved system of fixed exchange rates, this never materialized. Ins tead, countries \\nembarked on a series of experiments with different types of fixed and floating systems.  \\nFor example, the European Economic Community (now the EU) implemented the exchange rate \\nmechanism in 1979, which fixed each other’s currencies within an agreed band. These currencies \\ncontinued to float with non-EU countries. By 2000, some of these countries in the EU created a single \\ncurrency, the euro, which replaced the national currencies and effectively fixed the currencies to each \\nother immutably. \\nSome countries have fixed their currencies to a major trading partner, and others fix theirs to a basket of \\ncurrencies comprising several major trading partners. Some have implemented a crawling peg, adjusting \\nthe exchange values regularly. Others have implemented a dirty float where the currency value is mostly \\ndetermined by the market but periodically the central bank intervenes to push the currency value up or ', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Lastly, some countries, like the United States, have allowed  an \\nalmost pure float with central bank interventions only on rare occasions.  \\nUnfortunately, the results of these many experiments are mixed. Sometimes floating exchange rate \\nsystems have operated flawlessly. At other times, floating rates have changed at breakneck speed, leaving \\ntraders, investors, and governments scrambling to adjust to the volatility. Similarly, fixed rates have at \\ntimes been a salvation to a country, helping to reduce persistent inflation. At other times, countries with \\nfixed exchange rates have been forced to import excessive inflation from the reserve country.  \\nNo one system has operated flawlessly in all circumstances. Hence, the best we can do is to highlight the \\npros and cons of each system and recommend that countries adopt that system that best suits its \\ncircumstances. \\nProbably the best reason to adopt a fixed exchange rate system is to commit to a loss in monetary \\nautonomy. This is necessary whenever a central bank has been independently unable to maintain prudent \\nmonetary policy, leading to a reasonably low inflation rate. In other words, when inflation cannot be \\ncontrolled, adopting a fixed exchange rate system will tie the hands of the central bank and help force a \\nreduction in inflation. Of course, in order for this to work, the country must credibly commit to that fixed \\nrate and avoid pressures that lead to devaluations. Several methods to increase the credibility include the \\nuse of currency boards and complete adoption of the other country’s currency (i.e., dollarization or \\neuroization). For many countries, for at least a period, fixed exchange rates have helped enormously to \\nreduce inflationary pressures. \\nNonetheless, even when countries commit with credible systems in place, pressures on the system \\nsometimes can lead to collapse. Argentina, for example, dismantled its currency board after ten years of \\noperation and reverted to floating rates. In Europe, economic pressures have led to some “talk” about \\ngiving up the euro and returning to national currencies. The Bretton Woods sy stem lasted for almost \\nthirty years but eventually collapsed. Thus it has been difficult to maintain a credible fixed exchange rate \\nsystem for a long period. \\nFloating exchange rate systems have had a similar colored past. Usually, floating rates are adopte d when a \\nfixed system collapses. At the time of a collapse, no one really knows what the market equilibrium \\nexchange rate should be, and it makes some sense to let market forces (i.e., supply and demand) \\ndetermine the equilibrium rate.

When used wisely, monetary policy discretion can provide a \\nuseful mechanism for guiding a national economy. A central bank can inject money into the syst em when \\nthe economic growth slows or falls, or it can reduce money when excessively rapid growth leads to \\ninflationary tendencies. Since monetary policy acts much more rapidly than fiscal policy, it is a much \\nquicker policy lever to use to help control the economy. \\nPrudent Monetary and Fiscal Policies \\nInterestingly, monetary autonomy is both a negative trait for countries choosing fixed rates to rid \\nthemselves of inflation and a positive trait for countries wishing have more control over their domestic \\neconomies. It turns out that the key to success in both fixed and floating rates hinges on prudent \\nmonetary and fiscal policies. Fixed rates are chosen to force a more prudent monetary policy, while \\nfloating rates are a blessing for those countries that already have a prudent monetary policy. \\nA prudent monetary policy is most likely to arise when two conditions are satisfied. First, the central \\nbank, and the decisions it makes, must be independent of the national government that makes \\ngovernment-spending decisions. If it is not, governments have always been inclined to print money to \\nfinance government-spending projects. This has been the primary source of high inflation in most \\ncountries. The second condition is a clear guideline for the central bank’s objective. Ideally, that guideline \\nshould broadly convey a sense that monetary policy will satisfy the demands of a growing economy while \\nmaintaining sufficiently low inflation. When these conditions are satisfied, autonomy for a central bank \\nand floating exchange rates will function well. Mandating fixed exchange rates can also work well, but \\nonly if the system can be maintained and if the country to which the other country fixes its currency has a \\nprudent monetary policy. \\nBoth systems can experience great difficulties if prudent fiscal policies are not maintained. This requires \\ngovernments to maintain a balanced budget over time. Balance over time does not mean balance in every \\nperiod but rather that periodic budget deficits should be offset with periodic bu dget surpluses. In this way, \\ngovernment debt is managed and does not become excessive. It is also critical that governments do not \\noverextend themselves in terms of international borrowing.

The book is\\ndesigned for conceptual accessibility to students who are relatively early in their business curriculum (such as\\nsecond-year students), yet it is also suitable for more advanced students. Due to the wide range of audiences\\nand course approaches, the book is designed to be as flexible as possible. Its modular structure allows the\\nintroduction and review of content from prerequisite subjects in financial accounting, statistics, and\\nPreface 1', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It provides a solid grounding in the core concepts of financial\\ntheory so that business students interested in a major or minor in finance will also be prepared for more\\nrigorous upper-level courses. Concepts are further reinforced through applicable connections and practical\\ncalculation techniques for more detailed and realistic company scenarios from various industries.\\nPedagogical Foundation\\nPrinciples of Finance emphasizes financial concepts relevant to people working in a variety of business\\nfunctions. To illuminate the meaningful applications and implications of financial ideas, the book incorporates\\na unique use-case approach, providing connections among topics, solutions, and real-world problems. This\\nmultifaceted framework drives the integration of concepts while maintaining a modular chapter structure.\\nTheoretical and practical aspects are presented in a balanced manner, and select ethical considerations are\\nintroduced, particularly in the context of corporate governance.\\nIn order to create meaning for all students, Principles of Finance exposes them to a range of companies,\\nindustries, and scenarios reflecting different contexts. Examples of large companies such as Apple, Peloton,\\nand American Airlines are balanced with small businesses—coffee shops, clothing stores, and salons—that\\nmay be more aligned with student experiences. The text includes authentic narratives from corporate finance,\\nsmall business, and personal finance to drive relevance and interest of the discipline. Profiles and interviews\\ninclude diverse figures in finance, such as Carlos Slim, Irina Simmons, Janet Yellen, and Ben Bernanke.\\nProblems and exercises have been carefully constructed to place students into a range of settings and\\ncontexts as they develop knowledge and put it into practice. Finally, to reflect very recent experiences, the\\nauthors have incorporated several discussions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on people\\nand businesses.\\nThroughout, there is an emphasis on data use in business decision-making, with integrative sections on the\\nimportance and analysis of financial, economic, and statistical data. Data types include FRED\\n(https://openstax.org/r/fred-stlouisfed)® economic data, company financial statements, and stock prices.\\nPractical techniques and calculation examples for data analysis with financial calculators (the Texas\\nInstruments BA II Plus™ Professional model is used as the basis for example illustrations) and/or spreadsheets\\nare included for relevant topics. For key chapters, downloadable Microsoft® Excel® data files are available for\\nstudent reference. This technical feature provides students with access to the Excel data files used in the\\nchapter examples for time value of money (Chapters 7, 8, 9) and statistics (Chapters 14, 15, 16) problems. The\\ndownloadable files for the chapters covering financial forecasting and trade credit (18 and 19) allow students\\nto see how changing assumptions and variables impact financial decision-making. Chapters 13 and 14\\n(statistical and regression analysis, respectively) also include brief sections about the R software\\n(https://openstax.org/r/r-software) package to promote further interest in trends in data science.\\nTeaching Plan Options\\nPrinciples of Finance includes chapters on basic, applied, and integrative finance topics as well as key concepts\\nfrom prerequisite financial accounting, quantitative methods (statistics), and economics courses. The chapters\\non prerequisite topics highlight examples relevant to finance students. For instructors with a limited one-\\nsemester schedule or whose students have solid knowledge of prerequisite disciplines, we recommend\\nfocusing on the “core” chapters, as indicated in the following table of contents:\\n1 Introduction to Finance Core\\n2 Corporate Structure and Governance Core\\n3 Economic Foundations: Money and Rates Extension\\n4 Accrual Accounting Process Extension\\nTable 1\\n2 Preface\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Without good financial protocol,\\nsafeguards, and tools, running a successful business is more difficult. In 1978, Bacon Signs was a family-\\nowned, regional Midwestern sign company engaged in the manufacture, sale, installation, and maintenance of\\ncommercial signage. The company was about to transition from the second to third generation of family\\nownership. Bacon Signs, established in 1901, had weathered the Great Depression, World War II, the Vietnam\\nWar, and the oil embargo and was working its way through historically high rates of inflation and interest\\nrates. The family business had successfully struggled through the ebb and flow of the regional and national\\neconomy by providing quality products and service to its regional clients.\\nIn the early 1980s, the company’s fortunes changed permanently for the better. The owner recognized that\\nthe custom signs built by his firm were superior in quality to the signs it installed for national franchises. The\\nowner worked with the company’s banker and vice president of finance and operations to develop a\\nproduction, sales, and financing plan that could be offered to the larger national sign companies. The larger\\ncompanies agreed to subcontract manufacturing of midsize orders to Bacon Signs. The firm then made a\\ncommitment to build and deliver these signs on time and under budget. As Bacon Signs’ reputation for quality\\ngrew, so did demand for its products. The original financing plan anticipated this potential growth and was\\nIntroduction to Finance\\n1\\n1 • Why It Matters 7', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Financing was the key to expansion and\\nfinancial stability for the firm.1\\nIn this book, we demonstrate that business finance is about developing and understanding the tools that help\\npeople make consistently good and repeatable decisions.\\n1.1 What Is Finance?\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the main areas in finance.\\n• Explain the importance of studying finance.\\n• Discuss the concepts of risk and return.\\nDefinition of Finance\\nFinance is the study of the management, movement, and raising of money. The word finance can be used as a\\nverb, such as when the First National Bank agrees to finance your home mortgage loan. It can also be used as\\na noun referring to an entire industry. At its essence, the study of finance is about understanding the uses and\\nsources of cash, as well as the concept of risk-reward trade-off. Finance is also a tool that can help us be better\\ndecision makers.\\nBasic Areas in Finance\\nFinance is divided into three primary areas in the domestic market: business finance, investments, and\\nfinancial markets and institutions (see Figure 1.2). We look at each here in turn.\\nFigure 1.2 The Three Basic Areas of Study in Finance\\nBusiness Finance\\nBusiness finance looks at how managers can apply financial principles to maximize the value of a firm in a\\nrisky environment. Businesses have many stakeholders. In the case of corporations, the shareholders own the\\ncompany, and they hire managers to run the company with the intent to maximize shareholder wealth.\\nConsequently, all management decisions should run through the filter of these questions: “How does this\\ndecision impact the wealth of the shareholders?” and “Is this the best decision to be made for shareholders?”\\nIn business finance, managers focus on three broad areas (see Figure 1.3).\\n1 Dun & Bradstreet. “Bacon Signs, Inc.” D&B Business Directory. https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-\\nprofiles.bacon_signs_inc.90df737e33956dd7c76717a20e9d56ad.html#financials-anchor\\n8 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Working capital management (WCM) is the study and management of short-term assets and liabilities.\\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) and the finance team are responsible for establishing company policy for\\nhow to manage WCM. The finance department determines credit policy, establishes minimum criteria for\\nthe extension of credit to clients, terms of lending, when to extend, and when to take advantage of short-\\nterm creditor financing. The accounting department basically implements the finance department’s\\npolicies. In many firms, the accounting and finance functions operate in the same department; in others,\\nthey are separate.\\n2. Capital budgeting is the process of determining which long-term or fixed assets to acquire in an effort to\\nmaximize shareholder value. Capital budgeting decisions add the greatest value to a firm. As such, capital\\nbudgeting is thought to be one of the most important financial functions within a firm. The capital\\nbudgeting process consists of estimating the value of potential investments by forecasting the size,\\ntiming, and risk of cash flows associated with the investments. The finance department develops and\\ncompiles cash flow estimates with input from the marketing, operations, accounting, human resources,\\nand economics departments to develop a portfolio of investment projects that collectively maximize the\\nvalue of the firm.\\n3. Capital structure is the process by which managers focus more specifically on long-term debt and\\nincreasing shareholder wealth. Capital structure questions require financial managers to work with\\neconomists, lenders, underwriters, investment bankers, and other sources of external financial\\ninformation and financial capital. When Bacon Signs developed its financial plan, the executives included\\neach of these three aspects of business finance into the plan.\\nFigure 1.3 How Corporate Finance Decision-Making Activities Relate to the Balance Sheet\\nFigure 1.3 demonstrates how the three essential decision-making activities of the financial manager are\\nrelated to a balance sheet. Working capital management focuses on short-term assets and liabilities, capital\\nbudgeting is focused on long-term assets, and capital structure is concerned with the mix of long-term debt\\nand equity financing.\\nInvestments\\nInvestments are products and processes used to create and grow wealth. Most commonly, investment topics\\ninclude the discussion and application of the different types of financial instruments, delivery vehicles,\\nregulation, and risk-and-return opportunities. Topics also include a discussion of stocks, bonds, and derivative\\nsecurities such as futures and options. A broad coverage of investment instruments would include mutual\\nfunds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and investment vehicles such as 401k plans or individual retirement\\naccounts (IRAs). In addition, real assets such as gold, real estate, and commodities are also common\\ndiscussion topics and investment opportunities.\\nInvestments is the most interesting area of finance for many students.

However, we will need to make personal and\\nbusiness investment decisions, and many students reading this material will work in the investment industry\\nas personal investment advisers, investment analysts, or portfolio managers.\\nFinancial Markets and Institutions\\nFinancial markets and institutions are the firms and regulatory agencies that oversee our financial system.\\nThere is overlap in this area with investments and business finance, as the firms involved are profit seeking\\nand need good financial management. They also are commonly the firms that facilitate investment practices in\\nour economy. A financial institution regulated by a federal or state agency will likely handle an individual\\ninvestment such as the purchase of a stock or mutual fund.\\nMuch of the US regulatory structure for financial markets and institutions developed in the 1930s as a\\nresponse to the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression. In the United States, the\\ndesire for safety and protection of investors and the financial industry led to the development of many of our\\nprimary regulatory agencies and financial regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was\\nformed with the passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Major bank\\nregulation in the form of the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) and the Banking Act of 1935 gave rise to government-\\nbacked bank deposit insurance and a more robust Federal Reserve Bank.\\nThese regulatory acts separated investment banking from commercial banking. Investment banks and\\ninvestment companies continued to underwrite and facilitate new bond and equity issues, provide financial\\nadvice, and manage mutual funds. Commercial banks and other depository institutions such as savings and\\nloans and credit unions left the equity markets and reduced their loan portfolios to commercial and personal\\nlending but could purchase insurance for their primary sources of funds, checking, and savings deposits.\\nToday, the finance industry barely resembles the structure your parents and grandparents grew up and/or\\nworked in. Forty years of deregulation have reshaped the industry. Investment and commercial bank\\noperations and firms have merged. The separation of activities between investment and commercial banking\\nhas narrowed or been eliminated. Competition from financial firms abroad has increased, and the US financial\\nsystem, firms, and regulators have learned to adapt, change, and innovate to continue to compete, grow, and\\nprosper.\\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) formed in 2007 to consolidate and replace existing\\nregulatory bodies. FINRA is an independent, nongovernmental organization that writes and enforces the rules\\ngoverning registered brokers and broker-dealer firms in the United States. The Securities Investor\\nProtection Corporation (SIPC) is a nonprofit corporation created by an act of Congress to protect the clients\\nof brokerage firms that declare bankruptcy. SIPC is an insurance that provides brokerage customers up to\\n$500,000 coverage for cash and securities held by the firm.\\nThe regulation of the financial industry kicked into high gear in the 1930s and for those times and conditions\\nwas a necessary development of our financial industry and regulatory oversight. Deregulation of the finance\\nindustry beginning in the 1970s was a necessary pendulum swing in the opposite direction toward more\\nmarket-based and less restrictive regulation and oversight. The Great Recession of 2007–2009 resulted in the\\nreregulation of several aspects of the financial industry. Some would argue that the regulatory pendulum has\\nswung too far toward deregulation and that the time for more or smarter regulation has returned.\\n10 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The ease with\\nwhich banks could lower credit standards to allow ill-prepared consumers to purchase real estate and the\\nresulting speed with which the world economy plunged into recession is astounding.\\nRegulation to address the economic crisis was also swift. Fortunately, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the\\nFederal Reserve at the time, had throughout his career conducted extensive research into the causes of and\\npotential resolution of the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 He was uniquely qualified to lead the economic\\nresponse to the crisis. Some resulting laws moved to address the immediate needs and others to correct\\nthe underlying causes of the recession.\\nOne immediate fix was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP authorized the Treasury to buy\\nilliquid assets in order to save the financial institutions so important to lubricating our economy. Politically\\nthis was a tough decision, as it appeared that the government bailed out greedy bankers.

Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to protect\\nconsumers from harm caused by unscrupulous banking activities. Today, the hope is that financial\\ninstitutions will be stopped short of the gross negligence evident prior to 2007 and consumers won’t be left\\nout in the cold due to actions beyond their control.\\nSources: History Channel. “Here’s What Caused the Great Recession.” YouTube.

Finance is important for more immediate activities as\\nwell, such as the development of budgets to assure timely distribution of cash flows such as dividends or\\npaychecks.\\nAn understanding of finance and financial markets opens a broader world of available financial investment\\nopportunities. At one time, commercial bank deposits and the occasional investment in stocks, bonds, real\\nestate, or gold may have provided sufficient coverage of investment opportunities, portfolio diversification,\\nand adequate returns. However, in today’s market of financial technology, derivative securities, and\\ncryptocurrencies, an understanding of available financial products and categories is key for taking advantage\\nof both new and old financial products.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nJob Information\\nThe internet provides a wealth of information about types of jobs in finance, as well as reasons to study it.\\nInvestigate the Occupational Outlook Handbook (https://openstax.org/r/bls-gov) issued by the Bureau of\\nLabor Statistics to see how many of the career opportunities in finance look interesting to you.

The study of historical\\nfinancial markets demonstrates that this relationship generally holds true and that riskier investments over\\ntime have provided greater returns. Of course, this is not true all the time and under all conditions; otherwise,\\nwhere’s the risk?\\nAt its most basic level, risk is uncertainty. The study of finance attempts to quantify risk in a way that helps\\nindividuals and organizations assess an appropriate trade-off for risk. Risk-return tradeoffs are all around us in\\nour everyday decision-making. When we consider walking across the street in the middle of a city block or\\nwalking down to the marked intersection, we are assessing the trade-off between convenience and safety.\\nShould you buy the required text for your class or instead rely on the professor’s notes and the internet?\\nShould you buy that new-to-you used car sight unseen, or should you spend the money for a mechanic to\\nassess the vehicle before you buy? Should you accept your first job offer at graduation or hold out for the offer\\nyou really want? A better understanding of finance makes these types of decisions easier and can provide you,\\nas the decision maker, with statistics instead of just intuition.\\nReturn is compensation for making an investment and waiting for the benefit (see Figure 1.4).

Return could be\\nthe higher income received and the greater job satisfaction realized from investing in a college education.\\nIndividuals tend to be risk averse. This means that for investors to take greater risks, they must have the\\nexpectation of greater returns. Investors would not be satisfied if the average return on stocks and bonds\\nwere the same as that for a risk-free savings account. Stocks and bonds have greater risk than a savings\\naccount, and that means investors expect a greater average return.\\nThe study of finance provides us with the tools to make better and more consistent assessments of the risk-\\nreturn trade-offs in all decision-making, but especially in financial decision-making. Finance has many different\\ndefinitions and measurements for risk. Portfolios of investment securities tend to demonstrate the\\ncharacteristics of a normal return distribution, or the familiar “bell-shaped” curve you studied in your statistics\\nclasses. Understanding a security’s average and variability of returns can help us estimate the range and\\nlikelihood of higher- or lower-than-expected outcomes. This assessment in turn helps determine appropriate\\nprices that satisfy investors’ required return premiums based on quantifiable expectations about risk or\\nuncertainty. In other words, finance attempts to measure with numbers what we already “know.”\\nFigure 1.4 Risk and Expected Return This describes the trade-off that invested money can bring higher profits if the investor is\\nwilling to accept the risk of possible loss.\\nThe overall uncertainty of returns has several components.\\n• Default risk on a financial security is the chance that the issuer will fail to make the required payment. For\\nexample, a homeowner may fail to make a monthly mortgage payment, or a corporation may default on\\nrequired semiannual interest payments on a bond.\\n• Inflation risk occurs when investors have less purchasing power from the realized cash flows from an\\ninvestment due to rising prices or inflation.\\n• Diversifiable risk, also known as unsystematic risk, occurs when investors hold individual securities or\\nsmallish portfolios and bear the risk that a larger, more well-rounded portfolio could eliminate. In these\\nsituations, investors carry additional risk or uncertainty without additional compensation.\\n• Non-diversifiable risk, or systematic risk, is what remains after portfolio diversification has eliminated\\nunnecessary diversifiable risk.

The comptroller, or more commonly a controller, in a for-profit business relies heavily on a\\nknowledge of accounting. Controllers are in charge of financial reporting and the oversight of the accounting\\nactivities necessary to develop those reports. Controllers are concerned with payroll functions, accounts\\nreceivable, and accounts payable including taxes, inventory control, and any number of short-term asset and\\nliability tracking and monitoring activities. They aid internal and external auditors and are responsible for\\nmonitoring and implementing the day-to-day financial operations of the firm.\\nIn most organizations, the treasurer might assume many of the duties of the controller. However, the\\ntreasurer is also responsible for monitoring cash flow at a firm and frequently is the contact person for\\nbankers, underwriters, and other outside sources of financing. A treasurer may be responsible for structuring\\nloan and debt obligations and determining when and from whom to borrow funds. Treasurers are also\\nresponsible for investing excess funds. Where a controller may face inward toward the organization, the\\ntreasurer often faces outward as a representative to the public.\\nThe vice president of finance (VP-F) is an executive-level position and oversees the activities of the controller\\nand treasurer. The chief responsibility of the VP-F is to create and mentor a sufficient and qualified staff that\\ngenerates reports that are timely, accurate, and thorough.\\nThe chief financial officer, or CFO, is in a “big picture” position. The CFO sets policy for working capital\\nmanagement, determines optimal capital structure for the firm, and makes the final decision in matters of\\ncapital budgeting. The CFO is also forward looking and responsible for strategic financial planning and setting\\nfinancial goals. Compared to a VP-F, a CFO is less of a “hands-on” manager and engages more in visionary and\\nstrategic planning.\\nFinancial Planning\\nFinancial planning is critical to any organization, large or small, private or public, for profit or not-for-profit.\\nFinancial planning allows a firm to understand the past, present, and future funding needs and distributions\\nrequired to satisfy all interested parties. For-profit businesses work to maximize the wealth of the owners.\\nThese could be shareholders in a publicly traded corporation, the owner-managers of a “mom and pop” store,\\npartners in a law firm, or the principal owners of any other number of business entities. Financial planning\\nhelps managers understand the firm’s current status, plan and create processes and contingencies to pursue\\nobjectives, and adjust to unexpected events. The more thoughtful and thorough the financial planning\\nprocess, the more likely a firm will be able to achieve its goals and/or weather hard times. Financial plans\\ntypically consider the firm’s strategic objectives, ethical practices, and sources and costs of funds, as well as\\nthe development of budgets, scenarios, and contingencies. The financial plan Bacon Signs developed was\\nthorough enough to anticipate when and how growth might occur. The plan that was presented to commercial\\nbanks allowed the firm to be guaranteed new financing at critical moments in the firm’s expansion.\\nGood financial planning has a number of common features.\\n• It uses past, current, and pro forma (forward-looking) income statements. Pro forma income statements\\nare created using assumptions from past events to make projections for future events. These income\\nstatements should develop likely scenarios and provide a sensitivity analysis of key assumptions.\\n14 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

As with many of the financial topics introduced in this chapter, these activities are\\nvaluable for individuals and businesses alike. Budgeting, or planning for the amount, sources, and uses of\\ncash, occurs early in the planning process. It is common for businesses to have developed an annual budget\\nwell before the start of the year. With budgeting, a firm establishes objectives for the upcoming period by\\ndeveloping financial statements based on historical data and expectations, as well as aspirations for the\\nfuture. The budgeting process helps the firm identify what actions need to be undertaken to achieve its\\nobjectives. However, no matter how strong the budgeting process, actual events can change the timing and\\nmagnitude of expected cash flows.\\nFinancial forecasting addresses the changes necessary to the budgeting process. Budgeting can help identify\\nthe differences or variance from expectations, and forecasting becomes the process for adapting to those\\nchanges. We attribute to President Eisenhower the saying that “plans are worthless, but planning is\\neverything.” That statement applies to business today as well as it did during his service in the military and\\ngovernment. The budgeting or planning process is a road map for organizations, and forecasting helps\\nnavigate the inevitable detours toward the firm’s objectives.\\nThe budgeting process develops pro forma financial statements such as income and cash flow statements and\\nbalance sheets. These provide benchmarks to determine if firms are on course to meet or exceed objectives\\nand serve as a warning if firms are falling short. Budgeting should involve all departments within a firm to\\n1.2 • The Role of Finance in an Organization 15', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Forecasting adjusts management behavior in\\nthe immediate term and serves as a foundation for subsequent budgets.\\n1.3 Importance of Data and Technology\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Describe the role of data in finance.\\n• List and describe the various types of corporate data available.\\n• Explain how the various types of corporate data can be accessed and analyzed.\\n• Describe the impact of data digitization.\\n• Explain how stakeholders use data when making decisions.\\nImportance of Data\\nFinancial data is important for internal and external analysis of business firms. More accurate and timely data\\nleads to better business and financial decision-making. Financial budgeting and forecasting rely on the\\ncreation of several types of financial statements including income statements, the statements of cash flow,\\nand balance sheets, as well as the notes and assumptions used to create the financial statements. Insiders\\nsuch as executive and middle managers use financial data to evaluate and reevaluate decision-making. Having\\ncurrent and accurate data is key to making consistent value-adding decisions for a firm. Data helps inform\\nmanagers about how and when to finance projects, which projects to undertake, and necessary changes to\\nmake regarding physical, financial, and human resource assets. “Gut feelings” and “seat-of-the-pants”\\ndecision-making tend to be inconsistent with value maximization.\\nOutsiders also use publicly available data about firms to make purchasing, investment, credit, and regulatory\\ndecisions. Customers, investors, lenders, suppliers, and regulators must be able to access a firm’s financial\\ninformation. Investors need to determine how much they are willing to pay for a share of stock, banks need\\ndata to determine if a loan should be made, suppliers need financial information to determine if they should\\nsupply trade credit, and customers need to know that a firm has priced its products appropriately.\\nBasic Data Types\\nFinancial statements provide some of the data needed for decision-making. Firms summarize data and\\ndevelop at least three essential financial statements or reports.\\n1. The income statement summarizes the flow of revenues and expenses over a specified period. Income\\nstatements for publicly traded companies are available quarterly.\\n2. Statements of cash flow identify actual receipt and use of cash over a period.\\n3. Balance sheets show the existing assets, liabilities, and equity as of a particular date.\\nThese statements represent book values and reflect historical costs and accounting adjustments such as\\naccumulated depreciation. Book values often differ significantly from market values. Market values look\\nforward and reflect expectations, whereas book values represent what has occurred.\\nIn addition to the internal data summarized on financial statements, firms and outside stakeholders also seek\\nexternal sources of information. External data gathering includes surveys of customers and suppliers, market\\nresearch, new product development, statistical analysis, agreements with creditors, and discussions with\\ngovernment officials. Broader macroeconomic data is also valuable as it applies to expected market demand,\\nunemployment, inflation, interest rates, and economic growth.\\n16 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Businesses\\nnow create an e-trail, or virtual paper trail, to document, verify, and share processes. Because data is now\\nmuch easier to access, firms bear the added responsibility of ensuring that it is stored and secured properly so\\nthat individuals cannot inappropriately alter or delete information.\\nData storage has changed significantly in the last decade as companies have moved the storage of digital data\\nto the cloud. The advantages include only paying for the storage actually used, reduced energy consumption,\\naccess to specialized data protection services, and software and hardware maintenance. However, the risk of\\ndata hacks and the safety of data are key concerns in the storage of digitized information.\\nUses of Data\\nTaken together and separately, the internally generated financial statements can provide managers with a\\nwealth of information to enable superior decision-making. Harvard Business School identifies six ways\\nmanagers can use financial statements.3\\n1. Measuring the impact of business decisions such as new software, marketing plan, or product line\\n2. Aiding in the development of budgets by creating a starting point for future expectations\\n3. Aiding in cost cutting or the reduction of duplicate activities\\n4.

Do you opt for the more expensive high-tech production\\nequipment or reduce your upfront investment and pay higher labor costs over time? Is it better to finance a\\nnew product by borrowing money or selling new shares of stock? Should you manufacture overseas where\\nthe production costs are lower or in your own country where political and transportation costs are lower?\\nOnce you make your choice, how do you know if you’ve made the right decision? Understanding and\\napplying financial principles can help.\\nFor example, consider Peloton, the leader in social exercising with its bike, treadmill, and yoga platforms. In\\n2012, the principal founder, John Foley, was inspired to start the company because he lacked the time to\\nattend bicycle exercise classes due to his demanding career and growing family. He enjoyed cycling classes,\\nbut they could be expensive and often did not fit into his schedule. He recognized that the most popular\\ninstructors had developed a bit of a cult following and that the music playlist was a critical component for\\nmany followers. His choice of the company name, Peloton, comes from the French word for a “pack of bike\\nriders,” familiar to anyone who has even loosely followed the annual Tour de France bike race. The\\ncompany name evokes a measure of mystique and prestige.\\nPeloton started small and underwent five funding rounds in seven years before the company went public\\nwith an initial public offering in September 2019. Foley and his friends had the idea that they were a\\n“purposeful music company” and needed to touch on all aspects of the workout experience including the\\n3 Catherine Cote. “How and Why Managers Use Financial Statements.” Business Insights.

Think of the primary market as equivalent to the sale of new cars and the secondary\\nmarket as equivalent to the sale of used cars. In practice, many market locales trade both new and used\\nsecurities. For example, the stock markets trade equity securities daily, and most of the trading takes place\\namong individual and institutional investors who own shares in publicly traded companies. Trading a share of\\nAmazon, Facebook, or Nike stock has little impact and no direct cash flow to the underlying firm. However, the\\ninformation provided by such transactions is valuable, as it is a costly and public real-time statement by\\ninvestors of their perceptions of firm’s value and a reflection of satisfaction and expectations.\\nSome, though many fewer, transactions in the equity market are for the purchase and sale of new securities.\\nFirms issue new shares of stock called seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) or initial public offerings (IPOs) into\\nthe market. These are issues of new shares of stock, previously untraded, and their issuance sends cash flows\\ndirectly to the underlying firms. SEOs are new shares issued by established firms, and IPOs are new shares\\nissued by firms going public for the very first time. Once the initial transaction takes place, purchasers of these\\nnew securities may trade them. However, the second and subsequent trades are secondary, not primary,\\nmarket transactions.\\nExtensive primary market transactions take place weekly, when the Treasury Department auctions billions of\\ndollars of new Treasury securities. These new securities repay maturing Treasury securities and provide for the\\nongoing liquidity and long-term borrowing needs of the federal government. Again, subsequent trading of\\nthis government debt occurs as secondary market transactions.\\nKey Market Players\\nKey market players in finance include dealers, brokers, financial intermediaries, and you and me. Each of these\\nplayers facilitates the exchange of products, information, and capital in different ways. The presence of these\\nplayers makes financial transactions, easier, faster, and safer—essentially more efficient. You and your friends\\nmight engage in direct financial transactions, such as buying a coffee or borrowing money for a movie. These\\nare typically small transactions. However, for transactions that are larger or more complicated, you need\\nadvanced financial entities with capital, expertise, and networks. The two segments of the secondary markets\\nare broker markets and dealer markets, as Figure 1.7 shows. The primary difference between broker and\\ndealer markets is the way each executes securities trades.\\n6 Ibid.\\n1.5 • Markets and Participants 21', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

When a dealer engages in a financial transaction,\\nthey are trading from their own portfolio. Dealers do not participate in the market in the same manner as an\\nindividual or institutional investor, who is simply trying to make their investments worth as much as possible.\\nInstead, dealers attempt to “make markets,” meaning they are willing and able to buy and sell at the current\\nbid and ask prices for a security. Rather than relying on the performance of the underlying securities to\\ngenerate wealth, dealers make money from the volume of trading and the spread between their bid price\\n(what they are willing to pay for a security) and their ask price (the price at which they are willing to sell a\\nsecurity). By standing ready to always buy or sell, dealers increase the liquidity and efficiency of the market.\\nDealers in the United States fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission\\n(SEC). Such regulatory oversight ensures that dealers execute orders promptly, charge reasonable prices, and\\ndisclose any potential conflicts of interest with investors.\\nBrokers\\nBrokers act as facilitators in a market, and they bring together buyers and sellers for a transaction. Brokers\\ndiffer from dealers who buy and sell from their own portfolio of holdings. These firms and individuals\\ntraditionally receive a commission on sales.\\nIn the world of stockbrokers, you may work with a discount broker or a full-service broker, and the fees and\\nexpenses are significantly different. A discount broker executes trades for clients. Brokers are required for\\nclients because security exchanges require membership in the exchange to accept orders. Discount brokers or\\nplatforms such as Robinhood or E-Trade charge no or very low commissions on many of their trade\\nexecutions, but they may receive fees from the exchanges. They also do not offer investment advice.\\nFull-service brokers offer more services and charge higher fees and commissions than discount brokers. Full-\\nservice brokers may offer investment advice, retirement planning, and portfolio management, as well as\\nexecute transactions. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are examples of full-service brokers\\nthat serve both institutional and individual investors.\\nFinancial Intermediaries\\nA financial intermediary, such as a commercial bank or a mutual fund investment company, serves as an\\nintermediary to enable easier and more efficient exchanges among transacting parties. For instance, a\\ncommercial bank accepts deposits from savers and investors and creates loans for borrowers. An investment\\ncompany pools funds from investors to inexpensively purchase and manage portfolios of stocks and bonds.\\nThese transactions differ from those of a dealer or broker. Brokers facilitate trades, and dealers stand ready to\\nbuy or sell from their own portfolios. Financial intermediaries, however, accept money from investors and may\\n22 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

This lack of deposit funds and the\\nsubsequent behavior of the industry essentially eliminated the savings and loan industry and led to significant\\nderegulation of commercial and investment banking in the United States.\\nThe advantages of a robust network of financial intermediaries are many. They add efficiency to the financial\\nsystem through lower transaction costs. They gather and disperse information to minimize financial abuse and\\nfraud. They provide economies of scale and specialized knowledge. Finally, financial intermediaries are critical\\nfor the functioning of a capitalist economy.\\n1.6 Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define microeconomics and macroeconomics.\\n• Discuss the relationship between microeconomics and macroeconomics.\\n• Explain the importance of macroeconomic variables in finance markets.\\nMicroeconomics\\nIn the business setting, finance is the intersection of economics and accounting. Financial decision makers rely\\non economic theory and empirical evidence combined with accounting data to make informed decisions for\\ntheir organization. Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to\\nunderstand the how and why of human and financial capital allocation to governments, businesses, and\\nconsumers.\\nWe typically separate economics into two major areas, microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics\\nis devoted to the study of these decisions of allocation by individual businesses, persons, or organizations.\\nMicroeconomics helps us understand incentives and behavior, consumer choices and consumption, and\\nsupply and demand.\\nOur understanding of microeconomics aids in financial forecasting, planning, and budgeting by understanding\\nhow individuals are likely to respond to changes in product or service functionality, price, supply, quality,\\nmarketing, or other firm-induced stimulus. Empirical research by individuals, businesses, academics, and\\ngovernment provide evidence of what is going on and suggest what may change or stay the same.\\nMacroeconomics\\nWhereas microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals, macroeconomics examines the decisions of\\ngroups. Macroeconomic areas of study and concern include inflation, income, economic growth, and\\nunemployment. When Bacon Signs developed a financial and operating plan to expand the business, the firm\\nhad to consider unemployment and inflation when estimating its price of labor and materials. Bacon Signs\\nalso had to consider interest rates when estimating the cost of borrowing money to expand the business.\\nMacroeconomic modeling is limited because models cannot capture every variable in testing and application.\\n7 United States President and Council of Economic Advisers. “The 1970s: Inflation, High Interest Rates, and New Competition.”\\nEconomic Report of the President. 1991. https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/ERP/pages/6688_1990-1994.pdf\\n1.6 • Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters 23', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Economic Foundations expands on our discussion of micro- and macroeconomics.\\nImportance of Macroeconomic Variables in Financial Markets\\nTo make financial forecasts, managers need good information to understand the relationship among several\\neconomic variables. Working from small to large, sales forecasts estimate the likely price and quantity of\\ngoods sold. In doing so, the forecaster will consider local, regional, state, national, and international economic\\nconditions. Inflation is an important macroeconomic variable that influences prices. Every quarter, financial\\ninformation hubs, such as the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), and government agencies and regulatory bodies, such\\nas the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, release estimates about expected and current inflation.\\nThis information informs policy makers how to adjust the money supply to meet target objectives. Financial\\nforecasters pay close attention to current and expected interest rates, as they have a fundamental impact on\\nthe cost of raising money and determining the required rate of return for investment.\\nThe unemployment rate helps inform financial forecasters about the expected cost of labor and the ability of\\nemployers to hire people if a firm plans to increase the production of goods or services. The stock market is a\\nforward-looking macroeconomic variable and measures investor expectations about future cash flows and\\neconomic growth. Political economic variables such as changes in regulation or tax policy can also affect\\nforecasting models.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nPolitics and Stock Markets\\nPolitics and stock market returns make for heated conversations. Who can run the country’s economic\\nsystem better, Republicans or Democrats? Presidents often take the credit or blame for overall economic\\nperformance even though their actual influence is less than you might think. See this fun comparison chart\\n(https://openstax.org/r/macrotrends-net) of political economic performance that measures stock market\\nreturns by each administration going back to President Warren Harding in 1920. Who had the highest\\noverall increase in the market? What president in the 21st century oversaw an overall decline in the market?\\nJust to get things going, who had better overall market returns after four years in office, Donald Trump or\\nBarack Obama?\\nEach of the variables we have identified—inflation, interest rates, unemployment, economic growth, the stock\\nmarket, and government fiscal policy—are macroeconomic factors. They are beyond the scope and influence\\nof individual firms, but combined, they play a critical role in establishing the market in which firms compete. A\\nbetter understanding of the interaction of these macro variables with each other and with individual micro or\\nfirm-specific variables can only strengthen financial forecasting and management decision-making.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nHere, There, and Everywhere: Where Did Your iPhone Come From?\\nHow do international macroeconomic factors affect investment decisions for businesses and individuals?\\nForeign investment adds risk and potential return to the decision-making process. Macroeconomic factors\\nsuch as different inflation rates, unexpected changes in currency exchange rates, and mismatched\\neconomic growth all add to the uncertainty of making investments abroad. Just as important are\\ngovernment regulations limiting pollution, exploitation of precious minerals, labor laws, and tariffs.

Subsequently, when they each describe what they have discovered,\\nthe descriptions are vastly different. The group's members become upset, accusing one another of inaccurate\\ndescriptions or worse.

Financial decision makers need to see both the forest and the\\nindividual trees to chart a course and move toward a strategic objective. They need both the macro data, so\\nimportant for strategic thinking, and the micro data, required for tactical movement. For example, the national\\nrate of unemployment may not have been much help when Bacon Signs was searching for skilled laborers\\nwho could form neon signs.

Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts in excess\\nof $100,000. These large transactions are the norm when trading federal funds, repurchase agreements,\\ncommercial paper, or negotiable certificates of deposit. Our sample company, Bacon Signs, was much too\\nsmall to participate directly in the money market. However, Bacon Signs’ borrowing rates were affected by\\nchanges in the money market. Treasury bills are also a very important component of the money market, and\\nthey trade in smaller amounts starting at $10,000 per T-bill.\\nTreasury bills (T-bills), are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\\nNew York. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\\nsecurities. In addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where\\ninvestors can trade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills\\nhas exceeded $75 billion.9\\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as for inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper has a maturity of one to\\n270 days. The short maturity reduces SEC oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP\\nmeans that only highly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper. The default rate on commercial\\npaper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range during the financial crisis of\\n2008.\\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount with the face\\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue\\ncommercial paper; thus, returns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for\\nCP. Most purchasers are large, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial\\npaper until maturity.\\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\\nminimums amounts are $1,000,000 with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\\nNCDs differ in some important ways from the typical CD you may be familiar with from your local bank or\\ncredit union. The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and is protected by deposit\\ninsurance. However, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty\\nfrom the issuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount but is much larger than a\\nregular CD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to\\ncash out early, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher\\nrates on NCDs compared to CDs because they know they will have use of the purchase amount for the entire\\nmaturity of the NCD. The reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve are also lower than for other\\ntypes of deposits.\\nThe market for federal funds is notable because the Federal Reserve targets the equilibrium interest rate on\\n9 Henrik Bessembinder, Chester Spatt, and Kumar Venkataraman. “A Survey of the Microstructure of Fixed-Income Markets.”\\nJournal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis.

Many of the borrowing and lending\\nrates in our economy are a direct function of the federal funds rate.\\nCapital Markets and Instruments\\nThe capital market is the market for longer-term financial instruments.

The size of the Treasury market is quite large, as the US federal government over the years\\nhas accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion.10\\nTreasury notes are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2 to 10 years. The Treasury auctions\\nnotes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov in the same way they\\nwould a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in that they are longer term, pay semiannual coupon interest\\npayments, and pay the par or face value of the note at maturity. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and\\ntiming of note payments is fixed. However, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change.\\nLike T-bills, T-notes are generally exempt from state and local taxes. There is an active secondary market for\\nTreasury notes.\\nLonger-term Treasury issues, Treasury bonds, have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds are like T-notes in\\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates.\\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (“munis”).\\nLocal borrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is unlikely but possible.\\nThus, munis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to that of corporate bonds in that they receive a bond\\nrating based on the perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest\\npayments are tax-free. Interest on munis is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\\nstate and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.\\nJust as governments borrow money in the long-term from investors, so do corporations. A corporation often\\nissues bonds for longer-term financing. Bond contracts identify very specific terms of agreement and outline\\nthe rules for the order, timing, and amount of contractual payments, as well as processes for when one or\\nmore of the required activities lapse. A bond contract, known as an indenture, includes both standard\\n“boilerplate” contract language and specific conditions unique to a particular issue. Because of these non-\\nstandardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for trading used bonds typically requires a\\nbroker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.\\nAn important goal of business executives is to maximize the owners’ wealth. For corporations, shares of stock\\nrepresent ownership. Stocks are difficult to price compared to bonds. Bonds have contracts that specify the\\nnumber and amount of all payments made by the firm to the purchasers of bonds. Stock cash flows are far\\nmore uncertain than bond cash flows. Stocks might or might not have periodic dividend payments, and an\\ninvestor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future. However, no contract guarantees the size of the\\ndividends or the time or resale price of the stock. Thus, the cash flows from stock ownership are more\\n10 Trading Economics. “United States Government Debt.” Trading Economics. https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/\\ngovernment-debt\\n1.7 • Financial Instruments 27', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

College is expensive, and it is easy to spend\\nevery dollar you earn and to borrow to meet the rest of your obligations. Businesses, however, continually\\nmake decisions about when and how much money to borrow or invest. Bacon Signs established banking\\nrelationships to borrow money when needed to expand the business or a product line. Sometimes the best\\ndecision is to invest as soon as possible to grab opportunities, and other times it is better to delay new\\ninvestment in order to pay dividends to the owners of the company.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average Marches On!\\nOnce you begin to save and invest, here is a “fun fact” about the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)\\n(https://openstax.org/r/investopedia-djia), also known as the Dow 30. It first appeared on May 26, 1896, as\\na quick way for stock traders to assess if the stock market had gone “up or down” each day and by how\\nmuch. Here we are over 100 years later, and the Dow 30 index is alive and well. Of course, the 30 companies\\nhave changed, but the index does represent a continuous yardstick to measure stock performance over\\ntime. As Table 1.1 shows, it took from 1906 to 1972, or a little over 66 years, for the Dow 30 to increase\\ntenfold, from a value of 100 to a value of 1,000. The next tenfold increase from 1,000 to 10,000 took only a\\nlittle under 27 years from 1972 to 1999. Time will tell if or when the Dow 30 will top 100,000 at the closing\\nbell.\\nClosing Milestones Date\\n41 5/26/1896\\n100 1/12/1906\\n1,000 11/14/1972\\n10,000 3/29/1999\\n20,000 1/25/2017\\n30,000 11/24/2020\\nTable 1.1 The Dow 30 Closing\\nMilestones and Dates\\nImpact of Time on Saving and Spending\\nThe choice to spend or save and invest is really a choice between consumption today versus consumption in\\n28 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Economists, investment advisers, your friends, and mine love to discuss the trade-off of\\nconsumption now or later—even if not in those words. We have all heard conversations that go something like\\nthis: “Let’s go grab a beer—you can study for tomorrow’s exam in the morning.” Or “My father’s investment\\nadviser told me that if I invest $500 per month for the next 30 years and earn an annual rate of 10% on my\\ninvestments, I will have invested $180,000 over time but accumulated an investment portfolio worth over $1.13\\nmillion!”\\nAn important aspect of the trade-off between saving and spending involves your short-, intermediate-, and\\nlong-term goals. Delaying consumption until later comes with risks. Will your consumption choices still be\\navailable? Will the prices be attainable? Will you still be able to consume and enjoy your future purchases?\\nWhen saving for short-term objectives, the safety of the principal invested is important, and the value of\\ncompounding returns is minimal compared to longer-term investments. Most short-term investors have a low\\ntolerance for risk and hope to beat the rate of inflation with a little extra besides. An example could be to start\\na holiday savings account at your local bank as a way to save, earn a small rate of return, and assure that you\\nhave funds set aside for consumption at the end of the year.\\nAn intermediate investment may be to save for a new car or for the down payment on a house or vacation\\nhome. Again, maintaining the principal is important, but you have some time to recover from poor investment\\nreturns. Intermediate-term investments tend to earn higher average annual rates of return than short-term\\ninvestments, but they also have greater uncertainty and risk.\\nLong-term investments have the advantage of enough time to recover from temporary poor performance and\\nthe luxury of compounded returns over a long period. Further, long-term investments tend to have greater\\nrisk and higher expected average annual rates of return. Even though this is a business finance text,\\nsometimes a personal finance example is easier to relate to. To illustrate, Table 1.2 demonstrates four different\\ninvestment scenarios. In scenario 1, you invest $5,000 annually from ages 26 through 60 into an account\\nearning an average annual rate of return of 10% per year. Over your lifetime, you invest a total of $175,000,\\nand at age 60, you have an estimated portfolio value of $1,490,634. This is a healthy amount that has almost\\ncertainly beaten the average annual rate of inflation. In scenario 1, by investing regularly, you accumulate\\nroughly 8.5 times the value of what you invested. Congratulations, you can expect to become a millionaire!\\nCompare your results in scenario 1 with your college roommate in scenario 2, who is able to invest $5,000 per\\nyear from ages 19 through 25 and leave her investments until age 60 in an account that continues to earn an\\nannual rate of 10%. She makes her investments earlier than yours, but they total only $35,000. However,\\ndespite a much smaller investment, her head start advantage and the high average annual compounded rate\\nof return leave her with an expected portfolio value of $1,466,369. Her total is almost as great as the amount\\nyou would accumulate, but with a much smaller total investment.\\nScenarios 3 and 4 are even more dramatic, as can be seen from a review of Table 1.2. In both scenarios, only\\nfive $5,000 investments are made, but they are made earlier in the investor’s life. Parents or grandparents\\ncould make these investments on behalf of the recipients. In both scenarios, the portfolios grow to amounts\\ngreater than those of you or your roommate with smaller total investments. The common factor is that greater\\ntime leads to additional compounding of the investments and thus greater future values.\\nAverage Annual Rate of Return = 10%\\nAssumptions Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4\\nStarting investment age 26 19 14 9\\nEnding investment age 60 25 18 13\\nTotal investments 35 7 5 5\\nTable 1.2 Four Investment Scenarios: Assumptions and Expected Outcomes\\n1.8 • Concepts of Time and Value 29', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Accountants\\ntrack, record, and display value in the form of financial statements and footnotes. The numbers they present\\nare “book values” and represent what has occurred. Financial people like to speak in terms of “market values.”\\nMarket values are calculated using expected future cash flows discounted to today. Market values are the\\nprices that consumers pay for a product. Economic value is what we believe consumers are actually willing to\\npay for a product, service, or experience. For example, the price of a movie ticket may be $10, but there are\\nindividuals who are willing to pay far more for the experience of watching a movie on the big screen.\\nGenerally, the economic value is at least as great as the market value or current price of an asset. When Bacon\\nSigns planned for the future, the firm attempted to determine the economic value of its products when\\ncreating an optimal mix of price and quantity sold. Firms that produce unique products for clients may have\\nmultiple prices based on the estimated economic value of their good or service to the client. One way to think\\nabout the difference between market value and economic value is that market value is what you have to pay,\\nwhile economic value is what you are willing to pay.\\n30 1 • Introduction to Finance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

There are three broad areas of finance:\\nbusiness finance, investments, and financial markets and institutions.\\n1.2 The Role of Finance in an Organization\\nThe accounting department creates financial statements, and the finance department implements the firm’s\\npolicy objectives, monitors results, and responds to necessary strategic and tactical changes. Finance is\\nresponsible for budgeting and forecasting. Finance aids in establishing firm objectives and is responsible for\\nmeeting with creditors, lenders, owners, regulators, and other stakeholders that provide capital to the firm or\\nhave a claim against firm assets.\\n1.3 Importance of Data and Technology\\nMuch of the data used in business today has been available for many years. However, data today is more\\nattainable than ever due to technological advancements facilitating a user’s ability to gather, evaluate, and\\nstore information faster and more cost effectively than ever. Information is continually available, so the\\nquicker and less expensively firms can adjust to the arrival of new information, the more valuable they become\\nfor their stakeholders.\\n1.4 Careers in Finance\\nCareers in finance are plentiful, fulfilling, and well compensated. Introductory positions are available in areas\\nsuch as data collection and data entry. More skill and experience is required for roles such as data analysis and\\nforecasting. Eventually, executive-level positions such as CFO present themselves to the most qualified.\\nFinance careers are not limited to financial firms, as understanding finance is an important skill in government\\nregulatory positions, nonprofit management, and all types of commercial business—from real estate, to retail,\\nto manufacturing, to education.\\n1.5 Markets and Participants\\nFinancial markets are where buyers and sellers of financial securities come together to trade. The trading of\\nsecurities allows markets to value assets and signal value as new information arrives. Brokers operate to bring\\nbuyers and sellers together and receive commissions. Dealers trade from their own portfolios and are often\\nwilling to make markets for specific securities by agreeing to buy or sell at the current bid and ask prices.\\nFinancial intermediaries actually change or create new financial products.\\n1.6 Microeconomic and Macroeconomic Matters\\nEconomics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources. Economists attempt to understand the how and\\nwhy of human, physical, and financial capital allocation. Microeconomics is the study of factors affecting an\\nindividual’s consumption, and macroeconomics is the study of all the aggregate factors affecting an economy.\\nEconomics is important in finance due to the number of economic variables critical to good financial\\nforecasting.\\n1.7 Financial Instruments\\nMaturity is one method to differentiate among financial instruments. Using this methodology, we have money\\nmarkets and capital markets. Money markets consist of short-term marketable securities, and capital markets\\nfocus on longer-term securities such as bonds and stocks.\\n1.8 Concepts of Time and Value\\nThe concepts of time and value involve the resolution of conflict between consumption now versus\\nconsumption later. Time and value represent the trade-off between risk and expected return.

These managers and employees have an ongoing\\nobligation to pursue projects, policies, and corporate investments that will increase or promote stockholder\\nvalue over the long term. Although many companies focus on financially related goals, such as growth,\\nearnings per share, and market share, the main financial goal is to create value for investors.\\nKeep in mind that a company’s stockholders are not just an abstract group. Like the sole business owner, they\\nare individuals who have chosen to invest their hard-earned cash in a company. They are looking for a return\\non their investment in order to meet their own personal long-term financial goals, which might be saving for\\nretirement, a new home, or college education for their children.\\nIn addition to increasing value, it is also important to realize that a firm has important nonfinancial goals.\\nSome examples of these might include the following:\\n• Expanding sales to existing customers\\n• Increasing customer loyalty to the weaker brands\\n• Developing new products for current and potential customers\\n• Becoming international by setting up an online ordering service\\nCorporate Structure and Governance\\n2\\n2 • Why It Matters 39', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

One of the main concepts in finance is that the value of any asset is determined by the present\\nvalue of the stream of cash flows that the asset will provide to its owners over the course of time. In\\nsubsequent chapters, we will also be covering stock valuation in depth, and we will see that stock prices are\\nbased on cash flows expected in future years, not only on those coming in at the present time.\\nFor these reasons, stock price maximization, which leads directly to maximizing shareholder wealth, requires\\nus to take a long-term view of company operations. It is also important to realize that managerial actions that\\naffect a company’s value may not immediately be reflected in the price of a company’s stock but rather will\\nbecome evident in the long-term prospects of the organization.\\nIn the case of privately held companies, smaller firms, and sole proprietorships, there are no shareholders.\\nHowever, attention to long-term growth and maximizing the value of a firm is just as important a goal to the\\nowners, who are also usually senior management with the company.\\n2.1 Business Structures\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify the business form created by most organizations.\\n• Contrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over sole proprietorships.\\n• Contrast the advantages and disadvantages that the corporate form has over partnerships.\\n• List and describe characteristics associated with a hybrid business structure.\\nThe Most Common Types of Business Organization\\nThe functions of most executive management teams are very similar for most businesses, and they will not\\ndiffer in any significant manner based on how they may be structured or organized. However, the legal\\nstructure of any company will have a substantial impact on its operations, and it therefore deserves a\\nsignificant amount of analysis and discussion. The four most common forms of business organizations are the\\nfollowing:\\n1. Sole proprietorships\\n2. Partnerships\\n3. Corporations\\n4. Hybrids, such as limited liability companies (LLCs) and limited liability partnerships (LLPs)\\nThe vast majority of businesses take the form of a proprietorship. However, based on the total dollar value of\\ncombined sales, more than 80 percent of all business in the United States is conducted by a corporation.1\\nBecause corporations engage in the most business, and because most successful businesses eventually\\nconvert into corporations, we will focus on corporations in this chapter. However, it is still important to\\nunderstand the legal differences between different types of firms and their advantages and disadvantages.\\nSole Proprietorships\\nA proprietorship is typically defined as an unincorporated business owned by a single person. The process of\\nforming a business as a sole proprietor is usually a simple matter. A business owner merely decides to begin\\nconducting business operations, and that person is immediately off and running. Compared to other forms of\\nbusiness organizations, proprietorships have the following four important advantages:\\n1. They have a basic structure and are simple and inexpensive to form.\\n1 Aaron Krupkin and Adam Looney. “9 Facts about Pass-Through Businesses.” Brookings.

They are subject to relatively few government rules and regulations.\\n3. Taxation on sole proprietorships is far simpler than on other organizational forms. There are no separate\\ntaxes associated with a sole proprietorship, as there are with corporations. Sole proprietors simply report\\nall their business income and losses on their personal income tax returns.\\n4. Controlling responsibilities of the firm are not divided in any way. This results in less complicated\\nmanagerial decisions and improved timeliness of necessary corrective actions.\\nHowever, despite the ease of their formation and these stated advantages, proprietorships have four notable\\nshortcomings:\\n1. A sole proprietor has unlimited personal liability for any financial obligations or business debts, so in the\\nend, they risk incurring greater financial losses than the total amount of money they originally invested in\\nthe company’s formation. As an example, a sole proprietor might begin with an initial investment of\\n$5,000 to start their business. Now, let’s say a customer slips on some snow-covered stairs while entering\\nthis business establishment and sues the company for $500,000. If the organization loses the lawsuit, the\\nsole proprietor would be responsible for the entire $500,000 settlement (less any liability insurance\\ncoverage the business might have).\\n2. Unlike with a corporation, the life of the business is limited to the life of the individual who created it. Also,\\nif the sole proprietor brings in any new equity or financing, the additional investor(s) might demand a\\nchange in the organizational structure of the business.\\n3. Because of these first two points, sole proprietors will typically find it difficult to obtain large amounts of\\nfinancing. For these reasons, the vast majority of sole proprietorships in the United States are small\\nbusinesses.\\n4. A sole proprietor may lack specific expertise or experience in important business disciplines, such as\\nfinance, accounting, taxation, or organizational management. This could result in additional costs\\nassociated with periodic consulting with experts to assist in these various business areas.\\nIt is often the case that businesses that were originally formed as proprietorships are later converted into\\ncorporations when growth of the business causes the disadvantages of the sole proprietorship structure to\\noutweigh the advantages.\\nPartnerships\\nA partnership is a business structure that involves a legal arrangement between two or more people who\\ndecide to do business as an organization together. In some ways, partnerships are similar to sole\\nproprietorships in that they can be established fairly easily and without a large initial investment or cost.\\nPartnerships offer some important advantages over sole proprietorships. Among them, two or more partners\\nmay have different or higher levels of business expertise than a single sole proprietor, which can lead to\\nsuperior management of a business. Further, additional partners can bring greater levels of investment capital\\nto a firm, making the process of initial business formation smoother and less risky.\\nA partnership also has certain tax advantages in that the firm’s income is allocated on a pro rata basis to the\\npartners. This income is then taxed on an individual basis, allowing the company to avoid corporate income\\ntax. However, similar to the sole proprietorship, all of the partners are subject to unlimited personal liability,\\nwhich means that if a partnership becomes bankrupt and any partner is unable to meet their pro rata share of\\nthe firm’s liabilities, the remaining partners will be responsible for paying the unsatisfied claims.\\nFor this reason, the actions of a single partner that might cause a company to fail could end up bringing\\npotential ruin to other partners who had nothing at all to do with the actions that led to the downfall of the\\ncompany. Also, as with most sole proprietorships, unlimited liability makes it difficult for most partnerships to\\nraise large amounts of capital.\\n2.1 • Business Structures 41', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

A corporation is a\\nlegal business entity that is created under the laws of a state. This entity operates separately and distinctly\\nfrom its owners and managers. It is the separation of the corporate entity from its owners and managers that\\nlimits stockholders’ losses to the amount they originally invest in the firm. In other words, a corporation can\\nlose all of its money and go bankrupt, but its owners will only lose the funds that they originally invested in the\\ncompany.\\nUnlike other forms of organization, corporations have unlimited lives as business entities. It is far easier to\\ntransfer shares of stock in a corporation than it is to transfer one’s interest in an unincorporated business.\\nThese factors make it much easier for corporations to raise the capital necessary to operate large businesses.\\nMany companies, such as Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, originally began as proprietorships or partnerships,\\nbut at some point, they found it more advantageous to adopt a corporate form of organization as they grew in\\nsize and complexity.\\nAn important disadvantage to corporations is income taxes. The earnings of most corporations in the United\\nStates are subject to something referred to as double taxation. First, the corporation’s earnings are taxed;\\nthen, when its after-tax earnings are paid out as dividend income to shareholders (stockholders), those\\nearnings are taxed again as personal income.\\nIt is important to note that after recognizing this problem of double taxation, Congress created the S\\ncorporation, designed to aid small businesses in this area. S corporations are taxed as if they were\\nproprietorships or partnerships and are exempt from corporate income tax. In order to qualify for S\\ncorporation status, a company can have no more than 100 stockholders. Thus, this corporate form is useful for\\nrelatively small, privately owned firms but precludes larger, more diverse organizations. A larger corporation is\\noften referred to as a C corporation. The vast majority of small corporations prefer to elect S status. This\\nstructure will usually suit them very well until the business reaches a point where their financing needs grow\\nand they make the decision to raise funds by offering their stock to the public. At such time, they will usually\\nbecome C corporations. Generally speaking, an S corporation structure is more popular with smaller\\nbusinesses because of the likely tax savings, and a C corporation structure is more prevalent among larger\\ncompanies due to the greater flexibility in raising capital.\\nHybrids: Limited Liability Corporations and Partnerships\\nAnother form of business organization is the limited liability corporation (LLC). This type of business\\nstructure has become a very popular type of organization. The LLC is essentially a hybrid form of business\\nthat has elements of both a corporation and a partnership. Another form of organizational structure is\\nsomething called a limited liability partnership (LLP), which is quite similar to the LLC in structure and in\\nuse. It is very common to see LLPs used as the organizational form for professional services firms, often in\\nsuch fields as accounting, architecture, and law. Conversely, LLCs are typically used by other forms of\\nbusinesses.\\nSimilar to corporation structures, LLCs and LLPs will provide their principals with a certain amount of liability\\nprotection, but they are taxed as partnerships. Also, unlike in limited partnerships, where a senior general\\npartner will have overall control of the business, investors in an LLC or LLP have votes that are in direct\\nproportion to their percentage of ownership interest or the relative amount of their original investment.\\nA particular advantage of a limited liability partnership is that it allows some of the partners in a firm to limit\\ntheir liability. Under such a structure, only designated partners have unlimited liability for company debts;\\nother partners can be designated as limited partners, only liable up to the amount of their initial contribution.\\nLimited partners are typically not active decision makers within the firm.\\nSome important differences between LLCs and LLPs are highlighted in Table 2.1.\\n42 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

This is primarily due to the benefits of raising capital to\\nsupport long-term growth. It is interesting to note that LLC and LLP organizational structures were essentially\\ndevised by attorneys. They generally are rather complicated, and the legal protection offered to their\\nownership principals may vary from state to state. For these reasons, it is usually necessary to retain a\\nknowledgeable lawyer when establishing an organization of this type.\\nObviously, when a company is choosing an organizational structure, it must carefully evaluate the advantages\\nand disadvantages that come with any form of doing business. For example, if an organization is considering a\\ncorporation structure, it would have to evaluate the trade-off of having the ability to raise greater amounts of\\nfunding to support growth and future expansion versus the effects of double taxation. Yet despite such\\norganizational concerns with corporations, time has proven that the value of most businesses, other than\\nrelatively small ones, is very likely to be maximized if they are organized as corporations. This follows from the\\nidea that limited ownership liability reduces the overall risks borne by investors. All other things being equal,\\nthe lower a firm’s risk, the higher its value.\\nGrowth opportunities will also have a tremendous impact on the overall value of a business. Because\\ncorporations can raise financing more easily than most other types of organizations, they are better able to\\nengage in profitable projects, make investments, and otherwise take superior advantage of their many\\nfavorable growth opportunities.\\nThe value of any asset will, to a large degree, depend on its liquidity. Liquidity refers to asset characteristics\\nthat enable the asset to be sold or otherwise converted into cash in a relatively short period of time and with\\nminimal effort to attain fair market value for the owner. Because ownership of corporate stock is far easier to\\ntransfer to a potential buyer than is any interest in a business proprietorship or partnership, and because\\nmost investors are more willing to invest their funds in stocks than they are in partnerships that may carry\\nunlimited liability, an investment in corporate stock will remain relatively liquid.

Take a look at the Amazon\\nLLC company profile provided by Dun & Bradstreet (https://openstax.org/r/company-profiles-amazon).\\nWhy do you think such a large corporation is set up as an LLC?\\nIncorporating a Business\\nMany business owners decide to structure their business as a corporation. In order to begin the process of\\nincorporation, an organization must file a business registration form with the US state in which it will be based\\nand carry on its primary business activities. The document that must be used for this application is generally\\nreferred to as the articles of incorporation or a corporate charter. Articles of incorporation are the single\\nmost important governing documents of a corporation. The registration allows the state to collect taxes and\\nensure that the business is complying with all applicable state laws.\\nThe exact form of the articles of incorporation differs depending on the type of corporation. Some types of\\narticles of incorporation include the following:\\n• Domestic corporation (in state)\\n• Foreign corporation (out of state or out of country)\\n• Close (closely held) corporation\\n• Professional corporation\\n• Nonprofit corporation (several different types of nonprofits)\\n• Stock corporation\\n• Non-stock corporation\\n• Public benefit corporation\\nIt is important to note that articles of incorporation are only required to establish a regular corporation.\\nLimited liability corporations require what are referred to as articles of organization (or similar documents) to\\nregister their business with a state. Some types of limited partnerships must also register with their state.\\nHowever, sole proprietorships do not have to register; for this reason, they are often the preferred\\norganizational structure for a person who is just starting out in business, at least initially.\\nArticles of incorporation provide the basic information needed to legally form the company and register the\\nbusiness in its state. The state will need to know the name of the business, its purpose, and the people who\\nwill be in charge of running it (the board of directors). The state also needs to know about any stock that the\\nbusiness will be selling to the public. The websites of various secretaries of state will have information on the\\ndifferent types of articles of incorporation, the requirements, and the filing process.\\n2.2 Relationship between Shareholders and Company Management\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the difference between principals and agents.\\n• List and discuss various stakeholders associated with a company and its operations.\\n• Explain how management impacts the operations and future of a company.\\nStakeholders\\nA stakeholder is any person or group that has an interest in the outcomes of an organization’s actions.\\nStakeholders include employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, communities, and governments.\\nDifferent stakeholders have different priorities, and companies often have to make compromises to please as\\nmany stakeholders as possible.\\n44 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

They are entitled to vote on\\ncertain company matters and to be elected to a seat on the board of directors. One advantage of being a\\nshareholder is that creditors cannot compel shareholders to pay for any of the company’s financial obligations\\nor debts. However, being a shareholder includes responsibilities such as appointing the company’s directors,\\ndeciding on director compensation, setting limits on directors’ power, and monitoring and approving the\\ncompany’s financial statements.\\nTypes of Shareholders\\nThere are two types of shareholders: common shareholders and preferred shareholders. Common\\nshareholders are any persons who own a company’s common stock. They have the right to control how the\\ncompany is managed, and they have the right to bring charges if management is involved in activities that\\ncould potentially harm the organization. Preferred shareholders own a share of the company’s preferred stock\\nand have no voting rights or involvement in managing the company. Instead, they receive a fixed amount of\\nannual dividends, apportioned before the common shareholders are paid. Though both common shareholders\\nand preferred shareholders see their stock value increase with the positive performance of the company,\\ncommon shareholders experience higher capital gains and losses.\\nShareholders and directors are two different entities, although a director can also be shareholder. The\\nshareholder, as already mentioned, is a part owner of the company. A director, on the other hand, is the\\nperson hired by the shareholders to perform oversight and provide strategic policy direction to company\\nmanagement.\\nThe Differences between a Shareholder and a Stakeholder\\nThe terms shareholder and stakeholder mean different things. A shareholder is an owner of a company\\nbecause of the shares of stock they own. Stakeholders may not own part of the company, but they are in many\\nways equally dependent on the performance of the company. However, their concerns may not be financial.\\nFor example, a chain of hotels in the United States that employs thousands of people has several classes of\\nstakeholders, including employees who rely on the company for their jobs and local and national governments\\nthat depend on the taxes the company pays.\\nBefore a company becomes public, it is a private company that is run, formed, and organized by a group of\\npeople called subscribers. A subscriber is a member of the company whose name is listed in the\\nmemorandum of association. Even when the company goes public or they depart from the company,\\nsubscribers’ names continue to be written in the public register.\\nRole of Management\\nCorporations are run at the highest level by a group of senior managers referred to as the board of directors\\n(BOD). The BOD is ultimately responsible for providing oversight and strategic direction as well as overall\\nsupervision of the organization at its highest managerial level. From an operational standpoint, the practical\\nday-to-day management of a company comprises of a team of several mid-level managers, who are\\nresponsible for providing leadership to various departments in the company. Such managers may often have\\ndifferent functional roles in a business organization. The primary roles of any management group involve\\nsetting the objectives of the company; organizing operations; hiring, leading, and motivating employees; and\\noverseeing operations to ensure that company goals are continually being met.\\nIt is also important that managers have a long-term focus on meeting growth targets and corporate\\nobjectives. Unfortunately, there have been many examples of companies where the managerial focus was\\nshifted to short-term goals—quarterly or fiscal year earnings estimates or the current price of the company\\nstock—for personal reasons, such as increased bonuses and financial benefits. Such short-term thinking is\\n2.2 • Relationship between Shareholders and Company Management 45', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Every public company is legally required to install a\\nboard of directors. Nonprofit organizations and many private companies often establish a board of directors\\nas well, even if they are not legally required to do so.\\nThe board is responsible for protecting shareholders’ interests, establishing management policies, overseeing\\nthe corporation or organization, and making decisions about important issues. The board of directors acts as a\\nfiduciary for shareholders. The board is also tasked with a number of other responsibilities, including setting\\ncompany goals, creating dividend and stock option policies, hiring and firing chief executive officers (CEOs),\\nand ensuring that the company has the resources it needs to perform well.\\nBasic Structure of a Board of Directors\\nThe bylaws of a company or organization determine the structure, responsibilities, and powers given to a\\nboard of directors. The bylaws also determine how many board members there are, how the members are\\nelected, and how frequently the board members meet.\\nThe board must represent shareholder and management interests, so it is best for the board to include both\\ninternal and external members. Usually, there is an internal director and an external director. The internal\\ndirector is a member of the board who is involved with the daily workings of the company and manages the\\ninterests of shareholders, officers, and employees. The external director represents the interests of those who\\nfunction outside of the company. The CEO often serves as the chairman of the company’s board of directors.\\nFigure 2.2 Corporate Boardroom (credit: “495 Express Lanes Board Room” by Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce/flickr, CC BY\\n2.0)\\n46 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In Asia and the European Union,\\nthere are commonly executive and supervisory boards. The executive board is made up of company insiders\\nwho are elected by employees and shareholders. In most cases, the executive board is headed by the company\\nCEO or a managing officer. The supervisory board oversees daily business operations and acts much like a\\ntypical US board of directors. The chair of the board varies, but the board is always led by someone other than\\nthe prominent executive officer.\\nOversight: Corporate Governance\\nCorporate governance is a discipline that focuses on how a company conducts its business and the various\\ncontrols that are implemented to ensure proper procedures and ethical behavior.\\nAlthough many companies and managers do operate with a fair and honest philosophy, others will try to\\nexploit the temporary benefits of actions that fall outside ethical behavior. Companies do not always adhere to\\nlaws. You may have seen or read news stories about false reporting of earnings, failure to reveal financial\\ninformation, or payments of large bonuses to top executives shortly after a company files for bankruptcy.\\nIn one infamous example, the insurance giant AIG paid for a lavish trip to California for top employees of the\\ncompany immediately after declaring that the company was insolvent. It asked for and received financial\\nsupport from the US government in the bailout of 2008.2\\nAt other times, a company may cross the line between legal and illegal and violate the law in order to increase\\nprofits. Because of the potential for human self-interest and greed, governments have enacted laws and\\nregulations that require specific actions of a company or restrict its activities in an effort to ensure fair\\ncompetition and ethical behavior.\\nOften, Congress enacts laws and regulations in response to major economic or other highly visible events.\\nFollowing the great market crash of 1929, the US government created a new set of rules and regulations\\ngoverning the issuing and trading of securities, the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of\\n1934. The government also created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to oversee these laws\\nand regulations.\\nThe new laws required that firms make available specific financial information to current owners and\\nprospective owners and that the SEC approve the initial sale of securities to the public. More recently,\\nfollowing a series of major ethical lapses at some firms, the US government enacted new legislation in 2002.\\nOne of the most sweeping acts is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which requires, among other things, the\\nfollowing:\\n• That the CEO and chief financial officer (CFO) must attest to the fairness and accuracy of the company’s\\nfinancial reporting\\n• That the company implements and maintains an effective structure of internal controls responsible for the\\nreporting of financial results\\n• That the company and an external public accounting firm confirm the effectiveness of the controls over\\nthe most recent fiscal year\\nIn addition, SOX created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, outlining the prohibited activities of\\nauditors.

Boards are evolving from focusing primarily on the needs of top key individuals to\\nconsidering broader aspects of ethics, values, and corporate culture. Boards now oversee the monitoring\\nsystems being put in place and may take on direct responsibilities related to senior management.\\nThe Role of the Audit Committee\\nA strong independent audit committee (AC) is an important part of the corporate governance efforts of any\\nfirm. The AC is formed by the board of directors as a separately chartered subcommittee of the board of\\ndirectors. It reports regularly to the BOD and assists the board by assuming responsibilities for critical\\ncorporate financial matters, such as reviewing audit plans and findings, approving external public accountants,\\nand coordinating the efforts of both internal and external financial reviews and audits. The audit committee\\nprovides expertise in all financial and accounting matters for a company, and it is therefore a critical part of a\\ncompany’s corporate governance efforts.\\nSome important functions of the audit committee include\\n• confirming the accuracy of the firm’s financial reporting;\\n• verifying that systems of internal control and risk management are operating effectively;\\n• ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\\n• verifying the qualifications, independence, and performance of the external public auditing firm; and\\n• coordinating the activities and performance of the internal audit function.\\nThe role of the audit committee has significantly expanded over the years, and it has become exceedingly\\nimportant with the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Due to this increase in importance and recognition,\\nseveral boards have shifted some of the audit committee’s responsibilities to separately chartered committees\\nin order to create a balance of duties and ensure that those duties are effectively focused on and efficiently\\nexecuted. Some of these additional committees have been known to include a compensation committee, a\\ndisclosure committee, and a governance committee, and they all have related objectives that need to be\\ndocumented within the charter of each of the individual committees. It is important for the different\\ncommittees to have close working relationships so that the audit committee can help each one fulfill its\\nresponsibilities to senior management, the greater board of directors, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\\nThe audit committee performs an internal audit to review the organization’s corporate governance process\\nand to communicate any recommendations for changes. The audit committee will usually follow up and\\nmonitor the process put in place to implement any changes or necessary improvements. As with any other\\ncorporate function, the audit committee’s role is greatly affected by the legal, institutional, financial, cultural,\\nand political circumstances that impact the company.\\nImportance of Improving Oversight and Governance\\nIt is crucial to today’s corporate environment that firms do not lose sight of achieving and maintaining strong\\nand efficient oversight and governance. This is true despite the litany of other important items on the busy\\nagendas of most boards.\\nKeeping a focus on the critical ethics of management, as well as the traditional focus on the importance of\\nethics to the overall organization, is not only timely in this day and age but also sound business practice. The\\nimportance of establishing a comprehensive system of checks and balances cannot be overemphasized.\\nBeginning with the chief executive officer, these checks and balances need to progress through senior\\nmanagement, and they ultimately include the board of directors itself. Similar checks and balances need to\\nthen filter down though the rest of the entire firm. By taking the appropriate steps to improve corporate\\noversight and governance, overall business risk can be mitigated and future operational problems reduced.\\nAdditionally, such steps can lead to the positive effects of achieving sustainable operational and financial\\nbenefits for a company and its shareholders.\\n48 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Why do you\\nthink the company has won numerous awards and was featured in Fortune’s annual Blue Ribbon\\nCompanies list for 2021?\\nThe Importance of Independence in Boards of Directors\\nAn independent board of directors is composed of individuals who have no material interest in the company\\nother than their directorship. They maintain their independence by only accepting compensation from the\\ncompany for their BOD services. They also have their own information sources, instead of relying on\\ninformation provided by senior management of the company. It is considered a corporate governance best\\npractice to have independent members serve on boards of directors for both publicly and privately held\\ncompanies.\\nIn most cases, board members have no affiliation with activities or organizations that could result in conflicts\\nof interest. An example of this might be a scenario in which a board is considering the formation of a\\npartnership or alliance with an organization that is directly associated with one of its board members. In such\\nan instance, a director might be excused from participating in that decision process, particularly if it is clear\\nthat it would lead to potential conflict.\\nA board with a majority of independent directors can bring expertise and objectivity, which\\n• helps assure ownership that the company is being run legally, ethically, and in the best interest of\\nshareholders;\\n• allows for both independence and objectivity regarding senior managerial representatives and limits\\nsituations in which a key decision maker might have a vested interest or an “ax to grind”; and\\n• enables board members to advance discussions with no hidden agendas for self-advancement or other\\nself-profiting motives.\\nThe Importance of Diversity in Boards of Directors\\nAs mentioned earlier, diversity can be an important quality for any board of directors. Increasingly over recent\\nyears, corporate management has begun to appreciate the value of diversity in boards of directors. This has\\nresulted in a significant increase in the total number of women and people of color in boardrooms in the\\nUnited States. However, many business observers believe that corporate governance practices have a long\\nway to go in this respect. Increasing representation has now grown to become a high priority for most\\nbusinesses and organizations around the world.\\nBoard members face many challenges in making decisions effectively and efficiently as possible. Because of\\nsuch challenges, the potential objective of diversifying the boardroom competes with other worthy topics and\\nobjectives such as improving cybersecurity, advancing customer service, identifying and reducing risk,\\nimproving community relations, and positioning strategically within an industry.

In the field of corporate finance, agency problems are often related to a conflict of interest\\nbetween the management of a company and its shareholders.\\nFor many years, this has been a very common problem that has been seen in nearly every kind of organization,\\nirrespective of it being a church, a club, a not-for-profit organization, a multinational corporation, or any other\\ngovernment agency or institution. As with most problematic issues in business, agency problems can be\\nresolved, but only if organizations are willing to take the appropriate steps to resolve them.\\nEvery company has its own set of goals and objectives, but it is important to note that the employee and\\npersonal goals of managers may differ and may not align with the goals and objectives of stockholders\\n(ownership). Because these differences exist, and because all parties have a desire to maximize their own\\nwealth, agency problems can often arise, having a negative impact on company profits, stock price, and the\\ngoodwill of the shareholder base.\\nThere are three primary types of agency problems, discussed below.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nExample of an Agency Problem\\nABC Co. used to sell organic shampoo for $15, but the stockholders of ABC lobbied for an increase in the\\nselling price of the shampoo from $15 to $18. This was to increase earnings and, ultimately, their own\\npersonal wealth through an uptick in stock price. However, as a result of this unnecessary rise in the price\\nof the shampoo, customers were disappointed, and a majority of them wound up boycotting the product.\\nAdditionally, some of the consumers who continued to purchase the product noticed a decline in the overall\\nquality of the shampoo and were also very disappointed. In this scenario, agency problems surfaced\\nbetween stockholders and loyal customers of the company.\\nStockholders versus Management\\nLarge corporations typically have a substantial number of stockholders forming their ownership. It is essential\\nfor an organization to separate the management of a company from this ownership in order to avoid this type\\nof agency problem.\\nSegregating ownership from management can be advantageous for an organization. Doing so will usually not\\nhave any effects on normal business operations. At the same time, the company can employ different experts\\nand professionals to manage key operations of the business.\\nHowever, a drawback to this is that hiring outsiders may eventually become troublesome for shareholders.\\nExternal managers who are brought into a company may end up making self-serving decisions or even\\n50 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

From this example, we can see how individual greed on the part of agents,\\nexecutives, or corporate management can lead to significant agency problems.\\nInvestors versus Creditors\\nIf a company decides to engage in risky investments and projects in order to drive organizational profitability,\\nthese increased risk levels could threaten the company’s ability to service (repay) their debts, leading to\\npossible default.\\nThis additional risk could also result in creditors taking steps to devalue such debts, which in most cases refers\\nto company bond issues. In the end, if these riskier projects end up failing and the company loses money,\\ninvestors (bondholders) may also experience financial risk as bonds go into default or otherwise lose market\\nvalue. This then becomes a potential agency problem between bondholders (investors) and creditors.\\nStockholders versus Other Stakeholders\\nSituations may arise in which stockholders of a firm find themselves in conflicts of interest with other\\nstakeholders of the company. For example, employees of a firm might be asking for a general wage increase.\\nIf such a wage increase were voted down by stockholders, this could result in key employees departing the\\norganization, eventually leading to poorer business results and the dissatisfaction of other stakeholders in the\\ncompany as company profits decline. In such an example, we see the agency problem of stockholders versus\\nother stakeholders.\\nA more specific example of such an agency problem occurred in 2011, when Oregon-based food and gift\\nbasket company Harry & David was forced to file for bankruptcy.4 This was a direct result of the company\\nbeing purchased through a leveraged buyout that left the company saddled with a tremendous amount of\\ndebt. However, the most important factor leading to the company’s failure was the actions of Steven Heyer,\\nwho was a friend of the new owners and had been hired as CEO. Heyer, who was awarded an exorbitant\\nexecutive salary, was also allowed to sink the company into further debt. Harry & David has since emerged\\nfrom bankruptcy under new leadership. But this example should serve as a cautionary tale of what can happen\\nwhen stockholders are able to put their interests ahead of those of other stakeholders in a corporate\\nenvironment.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nInfamous Agency Problems\\nEnron\\nEnron is one particularly infamous example of an agency problem.

Madoff Investment Securities LLC\\nPonzi schemes are common examples of the agency problem. Agency theory claims that a lack of\\noversight and incentive alignment greatly contributes to these problems. Many investors fall into Ponzi\\nschemes thinking that taking fund management outside a traditional banking institution reduces fees and\\nsaves money.\\nEven though established financial institutions reduce risk by providing oversight and enforcing legal\\npractices, some Ponzi schemes simply involve taking advantage of consumer suspicions about the banking\\nindustry and financial markets. In this type of environment, the consumer cannot ensure that an agent is\\nacting in their best interest. Investments are made under limited or, in many cases, completely nonexistent\\noversight.\\nBernie Madoff’s scam is probably one of the most infamous examples of a Ponzi scheme. Madoff’s fraud\\nstarted with friends, relatives, and acquaintances in New York, but it ultimately grew to encompass major\\ncharities such as Hadassah, universities such as Tufts and Yeshiva, institutional investors, and wealthy\\nfamilies in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The cash losses of Madoff’s scheme were recently estimated to\\nbe between $17 billion and $20 billion. The returns he promised were higher than what most investment\\nfirms and banks were offering—so promising that almost all of his investors ignored any concerns they may\\nhave had and basically looked the other way. Madoff paid for any redemption requests with money that\\nhad been newly invested.\\nMadoff’s Ponzi scheme fell apart when he could no longer pay his investors. He was criminally charged,\\nconvicted, and given a 150-year prison sentence. Madoff died in April 2021 while serving his prison term.\\n(Sources: Diana B.

Even the threat\\nof such a takeover may be effective in reducing or eliminating these conflicts of interest. A hostile corporate\\ntakeover tends to unify and discipline a management or agent group, thus fostering a union of agent and\\nshareholder interests. When such a potential threat or outright ownership change is introduced to a company,\\nits managers are more likely to act in the best long-term interests of the shareholders in order to maintain\\ntheir leadership positions within the company.\\nBy better aligning agent (management) and principal (ownership) goals, agency theory attempts to bridge any\\ngulfs among employees, employers, and stakeholders that are created by the principal-agent problem. While it\\nis recognized as being nearly impossible for companies to eliminate the ongoing agency problem, it is also\\nrecognized that it is possible to minimize its negative effects.\\nImpact of ESG Ratings\\nIn recent years, many publicly traded companies, as well as many that are privately owned, are being\\nevaluated and rated according to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. These ratings and\\nevaluations are primarily conducted by third-party organizations. As a result, the investment community is\\nusing these reports and ratings to an ever-increasing degree in order to measure and assess corporate ESG\\nfactors and performance.\\nEnvironmental, social, and governance issues have become an important part of the investment community’s\\nevaluation of publicly traded companies. Each component of what is now referred to as ESG has equal\\nimportance in ongoing corporate evaluations, as per Figure 2.3 below. It is critical for the senior management\\nof any corporation to stay abreast of any and all ESG issues as they arise and take immediate corrective action\\nwhen necessary.\\nFigure 2.3 Importance of ESG Factors to a Business Concern\\nESG measurements and assessments have become very important to firms, as they often become the basis of\\nformal and informal buy recommendations by investment professionals. ESG ratings were originally developed\\nto assist in determining the general risk of ESG factors for any public company, but they have since grown to\\nbecome unique scores used by investors to gauge the potential attractiveness of investment in the subject\\ncompany.

IR involves elements of communication, marketing, and finance and is designed to control the flow of\\ninformation from the management of a public corporation to its investors and stakeholders.\\nBecause the investment community plays such a critical role in the overall growth and success of any\\ncorporation, it is imperative that firms maintain strong and open relationships with their shareholder or\\npotential investor audience. IR was developed to take responsibility for achieving and maintaining these\\ncrucial relationships.\\nInvestor relations are quite different from typical public relations practices. A firm’s IR group must work very\\nclosely with the accounting and legal departments, as well as with members of the senior management team,\\nsuch as the CEO and CFO.\\nAs might be expected, IR has far more regulatory obligations than standard public relations functions, largely\\ndue to corporate reporting requirements enforced by the SEC and the International Financial Reporting\\nStandards (IFRS). IR became significantly more important in 2002, when the United States Congress passed\\nthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), also known as the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection\\nAct. This legislation resulted in requirements that dramatically increased the extent of financial reporting for\\nany publicly traded company. SOX was enacted in an attempt to prevent the occurrence of corporate financial\\nscandals such as the one notoriously committed by the Enron Corporation that we discussed earlier.\\nIn summary, investor relations functions have responsibilities including, but not limited to,\\n• coordinating live shareholder meetings and press conferences;\\n• disseminating financial information to the investment community;\\n• conducting briefings to the financial analyst community;\\n• publishing the quarterly report and annual report; and\\n• addressing any issues that arise as a result of financial disclosure.\\nThe best time to form an internal IR function or to engage an IR firm is when a company begins the process of\\nbecoming publicly traded through an initial public offering, or IPO.\\nQuarterly Earnings Conference Calls\\nAs a result of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, all publicly traded companies are required to file certain\\n54 2 • Corporate Structure and Governance\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Further, financial reporting for these domestic organizations is to be completed using Generally\\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\\nInternational firms, while based in the United States, will typically maintain significant levels of international\\ninvestment and conduct operations that may be quite diverse, both geographically and culturally.

In this chapter, we explore some of the economic concepts that managers should use as part of\\ntheir strategic plan.\\n3.1 Microeconomics\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify equilibrium price and quantity.\\n• Discuss how changes in demand will impact equilibrium price and quantity.\\n• Discuss how changes in supply will impact equilibrium price and quantity.\\nDemand\\nMicroeconomics focuses on the decisions and actions of individual agents, such as businesses or customers,\\nwithin the economy. The interactions of the decisions that businesses and customers make will determine the\\nprice and quantity of a good or service that is sold in the marketplace. Financial managers need a strong\\nfoundation in microeconomics. This foundation helps them understand the market for the company’s\\nproducts and services, including pricing considerations. Microeconomics also helps managers understand the\\navailability and prices of resources that are necessary for the company to create its products and services.\\nA successful business cannot just create and manufacture a product or provide a service; it must produce a\\nproduct or service that customers will purchase. Demand refers to the quantity of a good or service that\\nconsumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices during a given time period, ceteris paribus (a\\nLatin phrase meaning “all other things being equal”).\\nLet’s consider what the demand for pizza might look like. Suppose that at a price of $30 per pizza, no one will\\npurchase a pizza, but if the price of a pizza is $25, 10 people might buy a pizza. If the price falls even lower,\\nmore pizzas will be purchased, as shown in Table 3.1.\\nPrice ($) Quantity\\n30 0\\n25 10\\n20 20\\n15 30\\n10 40\\n5 50\\nTable 3.1 Demand\\nSchedule for Pizza\\nThe information in Table 3.1 can be viewed in the form of a graph, as in Figure 3.2. Economists refer to the line\\nin Figure 3.2 as a demand curve. When plotting a demand curve, price is placed on the vertical axis, and\\nquantity is placed on the horizontal axis. Because more pizzas are bought at lower prices than at higher prices,\\nthis demand curve is downward sloping. This inverse relationship is referred to as the law of demand.\\n68 3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If you have had nothing to eat all day and you are hungry, you might be more willing to pay a high\\nprice for a pizza, and that pizza will bring you a great deal of satisfaction. However, after your hunger has been\\nsomewhat satisfied, you may not be willing to pay as much for a second pizza. You may only be willing to\\npurchase a third pizza (to freeze at home) if you can get it at a fairly low price. Second, demand depends not\\nonly on your willingness to pay but also on your ability to pay. If you have limited income, then as the price of\\npizza rises, you simply cannot buy as much pizza.\\nThe demand curve is drawn as a relationship between the price of the good and the quantity of the good\\npurchased. It isolates the relationship between price and quantity demand. A demand curve is drawn\\nassuming that no relevant factor besides the price of the product is changing. This assumption is, as\\nmentioned above, ceteris paribus.\\nIf another relevant economic factor changes, the demand curve can change. Relevant economic factors would\\ninclude consumer income, the size of the population, the tastes and preferences of consumers, and the price\\nof other goods. For example, if the price of hamburgers doubled, then families might substitute having a pizza\\nnight for having a hamburger cookout. This would cause the demand for pizzas to increase.\\nIf the demand for pizzas increased, the quantities of pizza purchased at every price level would be higher.

Rather than being concerned about individual markets or products, macroeconomics is\\nthe branch of economic theory that considers the overall environment in which businesses operate.\\nPerhaps you have heard your parents talk about how much they paid for their first automobile. Or maybe you\\nhave heard your grandparents reminisce about spending a quarter to purchase a Coke. These conversations\\noften turn to a discussion of how a dollar just doesn’t go as far as it used to. The reason for this is inflation, or\\na general increase in price levels.\\nIt is not that just the price of an automobile has increased or that the price of a Coke has increased. Over time,\\nthe prices of many other things, from the salt on your table to college tuition, have increased. Also, you were\\npaid a higher hourly wage at your first job than your parents and grandparents were paid; the price of labor\\nhas risen.\\nWhen economists talk about inflation, they are discussing this phenomenon of the price of many things rising.\\nInstead of tracking the price of one particular item, they consider the price of purchasing a basket of goods.\\n76 3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If you would like to compare the purchasing power\\nof a dollar amount in two different time periods, you can use the CPI Inflation Calculator\\n(https://openstax.org/r/cpi-inflation-calculator). You can enter a current dollar amount and calculate its\\nvalue in an earlier period. Alternatively, you can calculate the current value of dollar amounts from years\\nago.\\nHow Is Inflation Measured\\nEach month, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects price data and publishes measures of inflation.\\nThe measure most commonly cited is the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI is based on the cost of buying\\na fixed basket of goods and services comprising items a typical urban family of four might purchase. The BLS\\ndivides these purchases into eight major categories: food and beverages, housing, apparel, transportation,\\nmedical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services.\\nSometimes you will hear a core inflation index being quoted. This index is calculated by excluding volatile\\neconomic variables, such as energy and food prices, from the CPI measure. Energy and food prices can jump\\naround from month to month because of weather or other short-lived events. A drought can cause food prices\\nto spike; a temporary rise in gasoline prices can occur as a hurricane approaches the coastline. These types of\\nshocks are transitory in nature and do not represent underlying economic conditions.\\nWhile the CPI and the core inflation index are based on the prices that households pay, the producer price\\nindex (PPI) is based on prices that producers of goods and services pay for their supplies and raw materials.\\nThe PPI captures price changes that occur prior to the retail level. Because it indicates rising costs to\\nproducers, increases in the PPI can foreshadow increases in the CPI.\\nBoth the CPI and the PPI are calculated by the BLS. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) also calculates a\\nmeasure of inflation known as the GDP deflator. The calculation of the GDP, or gross domestic product,\\ndeflator follows a different approach than that used to calculate the CPI and the PPI. Instead of using a fixed\\nbasket of items and measuring the price change of that fixed basket, the GDP deflator includes all of the\\ncomponents of the gross domestic product. Prices are taken from a base year and used to calculate what the\\nGDP would have been in a given year if prices were identical to those in the base year.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nThe Billion Prices Project\\nAlthough the concept of inflation as a rise in the general price level is simple, measuring and documenting\\nthis increase is complicated. The CPI is designed to measure the cost of a market basket of goods that a\\ntypical urban family purchases. But what the typical family purchases over time changes. As an item in the\\nbasket becomes more expensive, families tend to substitute and replace the item with similar goods. Also,\\nthe quality of goods changes over time. Think of how purchases in a typical household have changed over\\nthe last two decades. Today, few families purchase answering machines, CDs, DVDs, or alarm clocks;\\nsmartphones have replaced many such products. Smartphones are even used to make purchases for\\n3.2 • Macroeconomics 77', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The graph shows that for the past\\n70 years, inflation has been the norm. Although inflation dipped into negative territory several times, each\\nperiod of negative inflation was short-lived. Also, you will notice that during the 1970s and early 1980s,\\ninflation was abnormally high; the inflation rate remained above 5% for approximately a decade. This was also\\nthe only time period in which the US economy experienced double-digit inflation. By the mid-1980s, inflation\\nhad fallen below 5%, and it has remained below 5% for much of the past 35 years.\\nFigure 3.10 Rate of Inflation Measured by the Consumer Price Index, 1947–20202\\nThe Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items (CPIAUCSL) is a measure of the average monthly\\nchange in the price for goods and services paid by urban consumers between any two time periods. It can also\\nrepresent the buying habits of urban consumers. This particular index includes roughly 88% of the total\\npopulation, accounting for wage earners, clerical workers, technical workers, self-employed workers, short-\\nterm workers, unemployed workers, retirees, and those not in the labor force.\\nThe CPIs are based on prices for food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation fares, service fees (e.g., water and\\nsewer service), and sales taxes. Prices are collected monthly from about 4,000 housing units and\\napproximately 26,000 retail establishments across 87 urban areas. To calculate the index, price changes are\\naveraged with weights representing their importance in the spending of a particular group. The index\\nmeasures price changes (as a percent change) from a predetermined reference date. In addition to the\\noriginal unadjusted index distributed, the BLS also releases a seasonally adjusted index. The unadjusted series\\nreflects all factors that may influence a change in prices.

GDP measures the value of all of\\nthe automobiles produced, apples grown, heart surgeries performed, students educated, and all other new\\ngoods and services produced in a current year.\\nHow Is GDP Measured?\\nGDP can be measured by adding up all of the items that are purchased in the economy. Purchases are divided\\ninto four broad expenditure categories: consumption spending, investment, government spending, and net\\nexports.

Federal spending would\\ninclude purchases of items such as a new military fighter jet and services such as the work of economists at\\nthe BLS. State governments purchase products such as concrete for a new highway and services such as the\\nwork of state troopers. Local governments purchase a variety of goods and services, such as books for the city\\nlibrary, playground equipment for the community park, and the services of public school teachers. In the\\nUnited States, government spending accounts for nearly 20% of the GDP.\\nSome items that are produced in the United States are sold to individuals, businesses, or government entities\\noutside of the United States. For example, a bottle of Tabasco sauce produced in Louisiana may be sold to a\\nrestaurant in Vietnam, or tires produced in Ohio may be sold to an auto producer in Mexico. Because these\\nitems represent production in the United States, these exports should be included in the US GDP. Conversely,\\nsome of the items that US consumers, businesses, and government entities purchase are not produced in the\\nUnited States. A family may purchase maple syrup from Canada or a Samsung television that was produced in\\nSouth Korea. A business may purchase a Toyota vehicle that was produced in Japan. These items are imported\\nfrom other countries and represent production in the country of origin rather than the United States. Because\\nwe already counted these items when adding consumption, investment, and government spending, we must\\nsubtract the value of imports in our GDP calculation. Net exports equals exports from the United States minus\\nimports from other countries. Including net exports in the GDP calculation adjusts for this international trade.\\nHistorical Trends in GDP\\nUS GDP over the past 70 years is represented by the blue line in Figure 3.12. At the turn of the millennium, the\\nyearly GDP of the United States was approximately $10 trillion. By 2020, the GDP exceeded $21 trillion,\\nindicating that the US economy had more than doubled in size in the first 20 years of the 21st century.5\\nBecause GDP is the market value of all goods and services produced, it can increase either because more\\ngoods and services are being produced or because the market value of these goods and services is rising. If\\n100 cars were produced and sold for $30,000 each, that would contribute $3,000,000 to the GDP. If, instead, the\\ncars were sold for $33,000 each, the same 100-car production would contribute $3,300,000 to the GDP. The\\n$300,000 increase in GDP would be due simply to higher prices, or inflation.\\nMultiplying the current price of goods by the number of goods produced results in what is known as nominal\\nGDP. In order to determine what the actual increase in production is, nominal GDP must be adjusted for\\ninflation. This adjustment results in a calculation known as real GDP. To calculate real GDP, the amounts of\\ngoods and services produced are multiplied by the price levels in a base year. Thus, real GDP will rise only if\\nmore goods and services are being produced. The red line in Figure 3.12 represents the real GDP. Although its\\ngrowth has not been as large as that of nominal GDP, real GDP has also grown significantly over the past 70\\nyears.\\n5 “GDP (Current US$): United States.” The World Bank. 2020. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US\\n3.2 • Macroeconomics 81', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

This market is referred to as the market for loanable funds.\\nIn the market for loanable funds, the suppliers of funds are economic entities that currently have a surplus in\\ntheir budget. In other words, they have more income than they currently want to spend; they would like to\\nsave some of their money and spend it in future time periods. Instead of just putting these savings in a box on\\na shelf for safekeeping until they want to spend it, they can let someone else borrow that money. In essence,\\nthey are renting that money to someone else, who pays a rental price called the interest rate.\\nThe suppliers of loanable funds, also known as lenders, are represented by the upward-sloping curve in Figure\\n3.17. A higher interest rate will encourage these lenders to supply a larger quantity of loanable funds.\\nThe demanders of funds in the loanable funds market are economic entities that currently have a deficit in\\ntheir budget. They want to spend more than they currently have in income. For example, a grocery store chain\\nthat wants to expand into new cities and build new grocery stores will need to spend money on land and\\nbuildings. The cost of buying the land and buildings exceeds the chain’s current income. In the long run, its\\nbusiness expansion will be profitable, and it can pay back the money that it has borrowed.\\nThe downward-sloping curve in Figure 3.17 represents the demanders of loanable funds, also known as\\nborrowers. Higher interest rates will be associated with lower quantities demanded of loanable funds. At lower\\ninterest rates, more borrowers will be interested in borrowing larger quantities of funds because the price of\\nrenting those funds will be cheaper.\\nFigure 3.17 Equilibrium in the Loanable Funds Market\\nThe equilibrium interest rate is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves. At that\\ninterest rate, the quantity supplied of loanable funds exactly equals the quantity demanded of loanable funds.\\nThere is no shortage of loanable funds, nor is there any surplus.\\n10 National Bureau of Economic Research. “US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions.” Last updated July 19, 2021.\\nhttps://www.nber.org/research/data/us-business-cycle-expansions-and-contractions\\n86 3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If you want to borrow money to purchase a\\ncar and the bank quotes an interest rate of 5.5% on a four-year auto loan, the 5.5% is the nominal interest rate.\\nOr suppose you have $1,000 you would like to place in a savings account. If the bank quotes an interest rate of\\n6% on its savings accounts, the 6% is a nominal interest rate. This means that if you place your $1,000 in a\\nsavings account for one year, you will receive $60 in interest for the year. At the end of the year, you will have a\\nbalance of $1,060 in your savings account—your original $1,000 plus the $60 in interest that you earned.\\nReal Interest Rates\\nSuppose you are deciding between saving your $1,000 for the year and using it to purchase a flat-screen TV.\\nThe advantage of spending the money on the TV today is that you can enjoy watching programs on it over the\\nnext year. The advantage of saving the money is that you will earn 6% nominal interest; in one year, you will\\nhave $1,060 to spend.\\nIf there is a 2% inflation rate, you would expect the TV that costs $1,000 today to cost $1,020 in one year. If you\\nsave the $1,000, you will have $1,060 in one year. You could purchase the TV for $1,020 and have $40 left over;\\nthen you could use the $40 to order pizza to celebrate the first big game you are watching on the new TV.\\nYour choice comes down to enjoying a TV today or enjoying a TV and $40 in one year. The $40 is your reward\\nfor delaying consumption. It is your real return for saving money. The remaining $20 of the interest you\\nearned just covered the rate of inflation. This reward for delaying consumption is known as the real interest\\nrate. The real interest rate is calculated as\\nThe real interest rate, rather than the nominal interest rate, is the true determinant of the cost of borrowing\\nand the reward for lending. For example, if a business had to pay 15% nominal interest rate in 1980, when the\\ninflation rate was 12%, the real cost of borrowing for the firm was 3%. The company would have had to pay $15\\nin interest each year for each $100 it borrowed, but $12 of that was simply compensating the lender for\\ninflation. In real terms, the business was only paying $3 to borrow $100.\\nIn recent years, a business may have paid 6% interest to borrow money. This nominal rate is half of what it was\\nin 1980. However, inflation has been much lower. If inflation is 1% and the company pays 6% nominal interest,\\nthat results in a 5% real interest rate. For every $100 the company borrows, it pays $6 in interest; $1 is\\ncompensating for inflation, and the remaining $5 is the real cost of borrowing.\\nRisk Premiums\\nAs we have discussed interest rates, we have talked about how the interest rate is determined by the demand\\nand supply of loanable funds. This tells us the underlying interest rate in the economy. You will notice,\\nhowever, if you look at the financial news, that there is more than one interest rate in the economy at any\\ngiven time.\\nFigure 3.18 shows the interest rates that three different types of borrowers have paid over the past 20 years.\\nThe bottom line shows the interest rate that the US government paid to borrow money for a three-month\\nperiod. This rate is often referred to as the risk-free rate of interest. While theoretically it would be possible for\\nthe US government to default and not pay back those people who have loaned money to it, the chances of that\\nare occurring are extremely low.\\nWhen someone borrows money, they enter into a contract to repay the money and the interest owed.\\nHowever, sometimes, certain circumstances arise such that the lender has a difficult time collecting the\\nmoney, even though the lender has the legal right to the money. For example, if a company goes bankrupt\\nafter borrowing the money and before paying back the loan, the lender may not be able to collect what is due.\\nThe chance that the lender may not be able to collect all of the money due at the time it is due is considered\\n3.4 • Interest Rates 87', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Lenders want to be rewarded for taking on this risk, so they charge a premium to borrowers who\\nare higher risk.\\nCompanies are more likely to go bankrupt and not be able to pay their bills on time than is the US\\ngovernment. So, corporations have to pay a higher interest rate than the US government. If a lender can earn\\n1% lending to the US government, the lender will only be willing to lend to the riskier corporation if they can\\nearn more than 1%. In Figure 3.18, the interest rates paid by very creditworthy companies is shown. The prime\\nrate is the interest rate that banks charge their very best customers—large companies that are financially very\\nstrong and have a very low risk of default.\\nIt is generally riskier for a lender to make a loan to an individual than to a corporation. Individuals are more\\nlikely to become ill, lose their job, or experience some other financial setback that makes it difficult for them to\\nrepay their loans. In Figure 3.18, the interest rate on credit card loans is much higher than the interest rate\\ncharged to corporate borrowers. That is because credit card loans are a high risk to the lender. Unlike other\\nloans made to an individual, such as a car loan, the credit card company has no collateral if a consumer cannot\\npay back the loan. With car loans, if the borrower fails to repay the borrowed money, the lender can repossess\\nthe automobile and sell it to recoup some of the money it is owed. If you use a credit card to buy groceries and\\ndo not repay the loan, the credit card company cannot repossess the groceries that you purchased. Therefore,\\ncredit card loans have notoriously high interest rates to compensate the lender for the high risk.\\nFigure 3.18 Interest Rate on US Treasury Bills and Credit Cards11 This graph shows the rates posted by a majority of top 25 (by\\nassets in domestic offices) insured US-chartered commercial banks.

If you live in the United States and are going on a trip to\\nMexico, you will need pesos to pay for your food, hotel, and other items. You will need to purchase pesos.\\nSuppose that you go to your bank to purchase pesos. Suppose the bank tells you that it will cost $0.0625 to\\npurchase one Mexican peso. If you want to take 10,000 Mexican pesos with you on your trip, it will cost you\\n$625 to purchase the desired pesos.\\nIn this example, the price of one peso is six and one-quarter cents. This price will often be written in the form\\nof\\nMXN is an abbreviation for the Mexican peso, and USD is an abbreviation for the US dollar. This price is known\\nas a currency exchange rate, or the rate at which you can exchange one currency for another currency.\\nBecause this is the price you would pay to purchase Mexican pesos right now, it is known as the spot\\nexchange rate.\\nIf you know the price of Mexican pesos in dollars, you can easily find the price of US dollars in Mexican pesos.\\nSimply divide both sides of the equation by 0.0625, or the price of a peso:\\nIf you have Mexican pesos and you want to exchange them for dollars, you will be using the pesos to buy\\ndollars. Each US dollar will cost you MXN 16.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nCurrency Conversion\\nDo you want to know how many British pounds your $100 would buy? Or would you like to see how much\\nthat 10,000-yen-per-night hotel room will cost you in your home currency? You can enter the amount of one\\ncurrency in the MSN Money currency converter (https://openstax.org/r/currencyconverter) to see what the\\nequivalent amount is in another currency.\\nCurrency Appreciation\\nJust as the price of gasoline changes, resulting in it costing more to purchase gasoline on some visits to the\\ngas station than on other visits, the price of a currency also changes. Currency appreciation occurs when it\\ncosts more to purchase a currency than it did before.\\nIf the next time you go to the bank to purchase pesos, the bank quotes an exchange rate of\\n, it means that it now costs $0.0800 (up from $0.0625) to purchase a Mexican peso.\\nHence, the price of a peso has risen, or the peso has appreciated.\\n3.5 • Foreign Exchange Rates 89', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

As exchange rates change,\\na business can be impacted in a number of ways. One of these risks, transaction exposure, is the risk that the\\nvalue of a business’s expected receipts or expenses will change as a result of a change in currency exchange\\nrates. A pottery-making business that has sold merchandise to a company in the United States for $20,000, for\\nexample, will need to exchange the $20,000 for pesos to be able to pay its workers and other expenses in\\npesos. How many pesos it will receive for $20,000 will change depending on the exchange rate. If the exchange\\nrate is , the company will receive 320,000 pesos for the $20,000. If the exchange rate is\\n, the company will receive 400,000 pesos for the $20,000. Thus, as the peso depreciates (and\\nthe US dollar appreciates), the same number of dollars will provide more pesos. Conversely, as the peso\\nappreciates (and the US dollar depreciates), the same number of dollars will provide fewer pesos.\\nFirms that hold assets in a foreign country also face translation exposure. When a company creates its\\nfinancial statements, items are reported using one currency. As foreign exchange rates change, the value of\\nhow items are reported on these financial statements can change. This type of risk is an accounting risk.\\nEconomic exposure is the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s number of customers\\nand sales. For example, tourists have the option of spending a week-long vacation at a resort in the United\\nStates or in Mexico. As the dollar appreciates, US citizens can exchange their dollars for more pesos, resulting\\nin their purchasing power going further at a Mexican resort. Because an appreciating dollar also means a\\ndepreciating peso, it would mean that Mexicans who earn pesos will receive fewer dollars when they exchange\\ntheir pesos. A Mexican who wants to stay at a $200-per-night hotel in Colorado will need more pesos to pay for\\nthe room when the peso depreciates. The depreciating peso will likely mean that more Mexicans will spend\\ntheir vacation week in Mexico, and fewer will vacation in the United States.\\nEven businesses that do not view themselves as involved in international business can face economic\\nexposure. The ski lodge in Colorado will find that its customers from Mexico decrease when the dollar\\nappreciates. Likewise, when the dollar appreciates, some of the ski lodge’s US-based customers may choose\\ninstead to visit a resort in Mexico, where their purchasing power is strong.\\n90 3 • Economic Foundations: Money and Rates\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Let’s assume that the market basket costs $300 in the base year. If the same\\nbasket of goods costs $330 the following year, then the index level the following year would be 110. The index\\nlevel increases by 10% when the cost of the market basket increases by 10%. This makes it easy to compare\\ndifferent measures of inflation.\\nFor example, suppose a market basket costs 40,000 yen in the first year and 42,000 yen in the second year. In\\nthe base year, the CPI in Japan would be set at 100; the following year, the index would rise to 105 (because of\\nthe 5% rise in the market basket cost). Comparing the levels of the index in Japan with the index in the United\\nStates allows you to compare inflation trends in the two countries.\\nTable 3.6 contains the CPI for the United States, Japan, and Switzerland for each decade since 1970. A base year\\nof 1970 is used for all three countries, so the index level is 100 for all three countries in 1970. You can see that\\nJapan has experienced virtually no inflation for the last several decades. If the index level remains the same\\nfrom one year to the next, there is a zero rate of inflation. Negative rates of inflation, or deflation, would be\\nassociated with a falling index level.\\nYear United States Switzerland Japan\\n1970 100.0 100.0 100.0\\n1980 212.3 162.3 232.5\\n1990 336.5 226.4 291.2\\n2000 443.5 278.2 322.1\\n2010 561.6 304.3 313.6\\n2020 666.6 302.3 331.8\\nTable 3.6 CPI Levels for the United States,\\nSwitzerland, and Japan15\\nUsing an index level helps us compare the impact that inflation has had on the cost of living in the three\\ncountries. Prices were rising rapidly in Japan in the 1970s, outpacing price increases in both the United States\\nand Switzerland. By the mid-1980s, however, price increases in Japan tapered off. Although prices in\\nSwitzerland rose much more slowly in the 1970s, the price level continued to rise over the next couple of\\ndecades. Even though the price increases have followed different patterns in Switzerland and Japan, the\\noverall price level today is about three times what it was in 1970 in both of those countries. However, the price\\nlevel in the United States has continued to rise; today, the price level in the United States is about seven times\\nhigher than it was in in the 1970s.\\n15 Data from US Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in US City Average\\n(CPIAUCNS).” FRED.

In the marketplace, buyers and sellers\\ncome together. The buyers are represented by a downward-sloping demand curve; lower prices are associated\\nwith a larger quantity demanded. The sellers are represented by an upward-sloping supply curve; higher\\nprices are associated with a large quantity supplied. The point of intersection of the supply and demand curves\\ndetermines the equilibrium price and quantity.\\n3.2 Macroeconomics\\nMacroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as inflation,\\nunemployment, and growth of production. The consumer price index is a common measure of inflation.\\nUnemployment equals the percent of the labor force that is without a job but looking for work. Gross domestic\\nproduct is a measure of the growth of production and growth of the economy.\\n3.3 Business Cycles and Economic Activity\\nThe business cycle is the repeated pattern of the economy experiencing expansion, a peak, contraction, and a\\ntrough. During the expansion, the economy is growing and real GDP is rising. During a contraction, also\\nknown as a recession, the economy is slowing down.\\n3.4 Interest Rates\\nThe interest rate is the rental price of money. The nominal interest rate is the quoted, or stated, rate of\\ninterest. The real rate of interest equals the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate. Lenders charge a\\nrisk premium to compensate them for lending to higher-risk borrowers.\\n3.5 Foreign Exchange Rates\\nA foreign exchange rate is the price of a currency in terms of another currency. If a currency will purchase\\nmore of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to have appreciated. If a\\ncurrency will purchase less of a foreign currency than it would previously, the purchasing currency is said to\\nhave depreciated.\\n3.6 Sources and Characteristics of Economic Data\\nOne of the most comprehensive sources of economic data is the FRED database, maintained by the Federal\\nReserve Bank of St. Louis. Over 765,000 time series of data are available. In addition to being viewable in\\ngraphical and text form on the FRED site, the data is easily downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet for analysis.\\nKey Terms\\nbusiness cycle a period of economic expansion followed by economic contraction\\nceteris paribus holding all other things constant\\nconsumer price index (CPI) a measure of inflation based on the cost of a market basket of goods that a\\ntypical urban family of four might purchase\\ncore inflation index a measure of inflation that removes food and energy prices from the CPI\\ndemand the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase during a given\\ntime period, ceteris paribus\\neconomic exposure the risk that a change in exchange rates will impact a business’s sales and number of\\ncustomers\\nequilibrium the point at which the demand and supply curves for a good or service intersect\\nequilibrium price the price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied\\nexpansion the part of the business cycle in which GDP is growing\\n3 • Summary 95', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Some private companies may choose to use cash-basis accounting rather than\\naccrual-basis accounting to report financial information.\\nCash-Basis Accounting\\nIn business, cash is certainly important. In fact, it’s so important that it dictates one of two ways we can\\naccount for our business transactions. The cash method is just as the name implies—it records transactions\\nonly when cash flows. We track cash inflows and outflows as they occur. This method is most commonly used\\nby small businesses that deal primarily in cash transactions. The other method, called the accrual method,\\nrecords transactions when they occur, rather than waiting for cash to be accumulated. Using the accrual\\nmethod, we match cash inflows and the outflows required to generate them. We call this the matching\\nprinciple. This method is used by most publicly traded companies. In this chapter, you’ll explore both methods,\\nsee how each impacts financial statements differently, note the role of timing in each method, and learn how\\nand when to record capital and expense transactions.\\nLet’s look at an example. Chris just finished the first month of her landscaping business operations at the end\\nof August, and she used the cash method of accounting to figure out her net income. Most small start-up\\ncompanies use the cash method of accounting because it is easy to understand, requires no special training,\\nand helps them focus on one big key to their survival—cash. This means that she simply recorded the cash\\nthat came in and the cash that went out of her business. She brought in $1,400 in revenue in her first month,\\nwhich she felt was substantial given that it was her first month. But after deducting her expenses, she had only\\n$250 left, so she worried about the future of her business. Would she have to increase her sales exponentially\\nin order to start bringing in a decent profit each month?\\nAs you move through the chapter, you’ll get to see the impact of the two methods of accounting and how\\nthese methods impact the insights and decisions Chris made for her new business.\\nCash-basis accounting is a method of accounting in which transactions are not recorded in the financial\\nstatements until there is an exchange of cash. Cash-basis accounting sometimes impacts the timing of\\nrevenue and expense reporting until cash receipts or outlays occur. For example, as you saw above, Chris\\nmeasured the performance of her landscaping business for the month of August using cash flows. Cash\\naccounting is far simpler to track than accrual-basis accounting.\\nAccrual-Basis Accounting\\nPublic companies reporting their financial positions use either US generally accepted accounting principles\\n(GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as allowed under the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission (SEC) regulations. GAAP is a set of accounting standards created by the Financial Accounting\\nStandards Board (FASB) and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). It’s key to note that\\nthough they are similar in many areas, there are still key areas that differ between GAAP and IFRS. Therefore,\\nwhen using financial statements, it’s important to be aware of the standards under which they were prepared.\\nHowever, public or private companies using GAAP or IFRS must prepare their financial statements using the\\nrules of accrual accounting. Accrual-basis accounting prescribes that revenues and expenses must be\\nrecorded in the accounting period in which they were earned or incurred, no matter when cash receipts or\\npayments occur. It is because of accrual accounting that we have the revenue recognition principle and the\\n102 4 • Accrual Accounting Process\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Having comparable information is important to external users of\\ninformation trying to make investment or lending decisions and to internal users trying to make decisions\\nabout company performance, budgeting, and growth strategies.\\nWho Uses Each Method?\\nCash-basis accounting can be more efficient and well-suited for certain types of businesses, such as farming or\\nprofessional services provided by lawyers and doctors. However, the accrual basis of accounting is\\ntheoretically preferable to the cash basis of accounting because it takes into account the timing of the\\ntransactions (when goods and services are provided and when the cash involved in the transactions is\\nreceived). Cash can often be received a significant amount of time after the initial transaction. Considering this\\namount allows accountants to provide, in a timely manner, relevant and complete information to stakeholders.\\nThere are several reasons accrual-basis accounting is preferred to cash-basis accounting. Accrual-basis\\naccounting is required by GAAP because it typically provides a better sense of the financial well-being of a\\ncompany. Accrual-based accounting information allows management to analyze a company’s progress, and\\nmanagement can use that information to improve their business. Accrual accounting is also used to assist\\ncompanies in securing financing because banks will typically require a company to provide accrual-basis\\nfinancial income statements. The Internal Revenue Service requires businesses to report using accrual-basis\\ninformation when preparing tax returns. In addition, companies with inventory must use accrual-based\\naccounting for income tax purposes, though there are exceptions to the general rule.\\nSo why might a company use cash-basis accounting? Companies that do not sell stock publicly can use cash-\\nbasis instead of accrual-basis accounting for internal management purposes or because they are exempt from\\nsuch requirements in agreements such as a bank loan. Cash-basis accounting is a simpler accounting system\\nto use than an accrual-basis accounting system when tracking real-time revenues and expenses.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nCash- or Accrual-Basis Accounting?\\nYou are a new accountant at a beauty salon. The salon had previously used cash-basis accounting to\\nprepare its financial records but is now considering switching to an accrual-basis method. You have been\\ntasked with determining if this transition is appropriate.\\nWhen you go through the records, you notice that this transition will greatly impact how the salon reports\\nrevenues and expenses. The salon will now report some revenues and expenses before it receives or pays\\ncash.\\nHow will this change positively impact its business reporting? How will it negatively impact its business\\nreporting? If you were the accountant, would you recommend the salon transition from cash basis to\\naccrual basis?\\nSolution:\\nAccrual accounting creates a more accurate picture of profit or loss, so the salon’s owner can have a better\\nunderstanding of its profitability from period to period. However, it can be more work to record under\\naccrual accounting. If the salon is small and the profits and costs are easily understood, it might not be\\nworth the extra effort to the owner to use accrual-basis accounting. If the salon is seeking ways to better\\nunderstand profits and costs, accrual-basis accounting would be a great choice.\\n4.1 • Cash versus Accrual Accounting 103', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In this section you will explore the impact business transactions have on\\nfinancial statements under each method. In doing so, you’ll be introduced to double-entry accounting and\\nsee how it functions to support the accounting equation.\\nTiming of Business Activity versus Cash Flow\\nThe first financial statement prepared is the income statement, a statement that shows the organization’s\\nfinancial performance for a given period of time. We already saw that Chris, who is a sole proprietor, started a\\nsummer landscaping business on August 1, 2020. She categorized her business as a service entity and used\\nthe cash-basis method of accounting to record the initial operations for her business. Although Chris was\\nusing her family’s tractor to get her work done, she was responsible for paying for fuel and any maintenance\\ncosts. So, on August 31, Chris realized she had only $250 in her checking account.\\nThis balance was lower than expected because she had spent only slightly less ($1,150 for brakes, fuel, and\\ninsurance) than she earned ($1,400)—leaving a net income of $250. While she would like the checking balance\\nto grow each month, she realized that most of the August expenses were infrequent (brakes and insurance)\\nand the insurance, in particular, was an unusually large expense. She knew that the checking account balance\\nwould likely grow more in September because she would earn money from some new customers; she also\\nanticipated having fewer expenses.\\nThis simple landscaping example can be used to discuss the elements of the income statement, which are\\nrevenues, expenses, gains, and losses for a particular period of time (see Figure 4.2). Together, these\\ndetermine whether the organization has net income (where revenues and gains are greater than expenses\\nand losses) or net loss (where expenses and losses are greater than revenues and gains). Revenues, expenses,\\ngains, and losses are further defined in the Income Statement provided.\\nFigure 4.2 Income Statement for Chris’s Landscaping\\nThe income statement can also be visualized by the formula:\\nLet’s change this example slightly and assume the $1,000 payment to the insurance company will be paid in\\n104 4 • Accrual Accounting Process\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In this case, the ending balance in Chris’s checking account would be $1,250,\\na result of earning $1,400 and only spending $100 for the brakes on the tractor and $50 for fuel. This stream of\\ncash flows is an example of cash-basis accounting because it reflects when payments are received and made,\\nnot necessarily the time period that they affect. At the end of this section, you will address accrual accounting,\\nwhich does reflect the time period that payments affect.\\nThe Accounting Equation\\nIt may be helpful to think of the accounting equation from a “sources and claims” perspective. Under this\\napproach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by incurring liabilities or were provided\\nby owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\\nYou may recall from mathematics courses that an equation must always be in balance. Therefore, we must\\nensure that the two sides of the accounting equation are always equal. We will explore the components of the\\naccounting equation in more detail shortly. First, we need to examine several underlying concepts that form\\nthe foundation for the accounting equation: the double-entry accounting system, debits and credits, and the\\n“normal” balance for each account that is part of a formal accounting system.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nThe Accounting Equation\\nOn a sheet of paper, use three columns to create your own accounting equation. In the first column, list all\\nthe things you own (assets). List only the asset itself; don’t worry about any associated liabilities (expenses)\\nin that column. In the second column, list any amounts owed (the liabilities). When you are done, total up\\nall the assets. Then total up all the liabilities.\\nNow, use the accounting equation to calculate the net amount of the asset (equity). To do so, subtract the\\ntotal assets from the total liabilities. This figure makes the accounting equation balance and represents\\nequity, or an estimate of your net worth.\\nHere is something else to consider: Is it possible to have negative equity? It sure is . . . ask any college\\nstudent who has taken out loans. At first glance there is no asset directly associated with the amount of the\\nloan. But is that, in fact, the case? You might ask yourself why you should make an investment in a college\\neducation—what is the benefit (asset) to going to college? The answer lies in the difference in lifetime\\nearnings with a college degree versus without a college degree. This is influenced by many things, including\\nthe supply and demand of jobs and employees. It is also influenced by the earnings for the type of college\\ndegree pursued.\\nSolution:\\nAnswers will vary but may include vehicles, clothing, electronics (include cell phones and computer/gaming\\nsystems), and sports equipment. They may also include money owed on these assets, most likely vehicles\\nand perhaps cell phones. In the case of a student loan, there may be a liability with no corresponding asset\\n(yet). Responses should be able to evaluate the benefit of investing in college and the wage differential\\nbetween earnings with and without a college degree.\\nLet’s continue our exploration of the accounting equation, focusing on the equity component in particular.\\nRecall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization. It is helpful to also think of net worth as the\\naccounting value of the organization. Recall, too, that revenues (inflows as a result of providing goods and\\nservices) increase the accounting value of the organization. So every dollar of revenue an organization\\ngenerates increases the overall value of the organization.\\n4.2 • Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting 105', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Her liabilities are currently $0, as she paid cash\\nfor all the expenses she incurred already. If we total her assets, we get $250. Liabilities total $0.

Having two\\nor more accounts change will allow us to keep the accounting equation in balance.\\n• Not only will at least two accounts change, but there must also be at least one debit and one credit side\\nimpacted.\\n• The sum of the debits must equal the sum of the credits for each transaction.\\nIn order for companies to record the myriad of transactions they have each year, there is a need for a simple\\nbut detailed system. Journals are useful tools to meet this need.\\nDebits and Credits\\nEach account can be represented visually by splitting the account into left and right sides as shown. The\\ngraphic representation of a general ledger account is known as a T-account. It is called this because it looks\\nlike a “T,” as you can see with the T-account shown in Figure 4.3.\\nFigure 4.3 T-Account\\nA debit records financial information on the left side of each account. A credit records financial information on\\nthe right side of an account. One side of each account will increase, and the other side will decrease. The\\nending account balance is found by calculating the difference between debits and credits for each account.\\nYou will often see the terms debit and credit represented in shorthand, written as DR or dr and CR or cr,\\nrespectively. Depending on the account type, the sides that increase and decrease may vary.

Just as the $1,400 revenues\\nfrom a business made Chris’s checking account balance increase, revenues increase the value of a business. In\\naccounting, revenue recognition involves recording sales or fees earned within the period earned. Just as\\nearning wages from a business or summer job reflects the number of hours worked for a given rate of pay or\\npayments from clients for services rendered, revenues (and the other terms) are used to indicate the dollar\\nvalue of goods and services provided to customers for a given period of time.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nCoffee Shop Products\\nThink about a coffee shop in your area.

In some businesses, there are two ways the\\ncustomers pay: cash and credit (also referred to as “on account”). Cash sales include checks and credit cards\\nand are paid at the time of the sale. Credit sales (not to be confused with credit card sales) allow the customer\\nto take the merchandise but pay within a specified period of time, usually up to 45 days.\\nA cash sale would be recorded in the financial statements under both the cash basis and accrual basis of\\naccounting. It makes sense because the customer received the merchandise and paid the business at the\\nsame time. It is considered two events that occur simultaneously (exchange of merchandise for cash).\\nA credit sale, however, would be treated differently under each of these types of accounting. Under the cash\\nbasis of accounting, a credit sale would not be recorded in the financial statements until the cash is received,\\nunder terms stipulated by the seller. For example, assume that in the next year of Chris’s landscaping\\nbusiness, on April 1, she provides $500 worth of services to one of her customers. The sale is made on account,\\nwith the payment due 45 days later. Under the cash basis of accounting, the revenue would not be recorded\\nuntil May 16, when the cash was received. Under the accrual basis of accounting, this sale would be recorded\\nin the financial statements at the time the services were provided, April 1. The reason the sale would be\\nrecorded is that, under accrual accounting, the business reports that it provided $500 worth of services to its\\ncustomer. The fact that the customers will pay later is viewed as a separate transaction under accrual\\naccounting (see Figure 4.6).\\nFigure 4.6 Credit versus Cash On the left is a credit sale recorded under the cash basis of accounting.

To provide an industry-wide approach, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 and other\\nrelated updates were implemented to clarify revenue recognition rules. The American Institute of Certified\\nPublic Accountants (AICPA) announced that these updates would replace US GAAP’s current industry-\\nspecific revenue recognition practices with a principle-based approach, potentially affecting both day-to-\\nday business accounting and the execution of business contracts with customers.1 The AICPA and the\\nInternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) require professional accountants to act with due care and to\\nremain abreast of new accounting rules and methods of accounting for different transactions, including\\nrevenue recognition.\\nThe IFAC emphasizes the role of professional accountants working within a business in ensuring the quality\\nof financial reporting: “Management is responsible for the financial information produced by the company.\\nAs such, professional accountants in businesses therefore have the task of defending the quality of financial\\nreporting right at the source where the numbers and figures are produced!”2 In accordance with proper\\nrevenue recognition, accountants do not recognize revenue before it is earned.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nGift Card Revenue Recognition\\nGift cards have become an essential part of revenue generation and growth for many businesses. Although\\nthey are practical for consumers and are a low cost for businesses, navigating revenue recognition\\nguidelines can be difficult. Gift cards with expiration dates require that revenue recognition be delayed until\\ncustomer use or expiration. However, most gift cards now have no expiration date. So when do you\\nrecognize revenue?\\nCompanies may need to provide an estimation of projected (or deferred) gift card revenue and usage\\nduring a period based on past experience or industry standards. There are a few rules governing reporting.\\nIf a company determines that a portion of all the issued gift cards will never be used, it may write this off to\\nincome. In some states, if a gift card remains unused, in part or in full, the unused portion of the card is\\ntransferred to the state government. It is considered unclaimed property for the customer, meaning that\\nthe company cannot keep these funds as revenue because, in this case, they have reverted to the state\\ngovernment.\\nExpense Recognition\\nAn expense is a cost associated with providing goods or services to customers. In our opening example, the\\nexpenses that Chris incurred totaled $1,150 (consisting of $100 for brakes, $50 for fuel, and $1,000 for\\ninsurance). You might think of expenses as the opposite of revenue, in that expenses reduce Chris’s checking\\naccount balance. Likewise, expenses decrease the value of the business and represent the dollar value of costs\\nincurred to provide goods and services to customers for a given period of time.\\n1 American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). “Revenue Recognition.” n.d. https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/\\naccountingfinancialreporting/revenuerecognition.html\\n2 Len Jui and Jessie Wong. “Roles and Importance of Professional Accountants in Business.” China Accounting Journal.

For accounting purposes, assets are categorized as current versus long term\\nand tangible versus intangible. Any asset that is expected to be used by the business for more than one year is\\nconsidered a long-term asset. These assets are not intended for resale and are anticipated to help generate\\nrevenue for the business in the future. Some common long-term assets are computers and other office\\nmachines, buildings, vehicles, software, computer code, and copyrights. Although these are all considered\\nlong-term assets, some are tangible and some are intangible.\\nTo better understand the nature of fixed assets, let’s get to know Liam and their new business. Liam is excited\\nto be graduating from their MBA program and looks forward to having more time to pursue their business\\nventure. During one of their courses, Liam came up with the business idea of creating trendy workout attire.\\nFor their class project, they started silk-screening vintage album cover designs onto tanks, tees, and yoga\\npants. They tested the market by selling their wares on campus and were surprised how quickly and how often\\nthey sold out. In fact, sales were high enough that they decided to go into business for themselves. One of\\ntheir first decisions involved whether they should continue to pay someone else to silk-screen their designs or\\ndo their own silk-screening. To do their own silk-screening, they would need to invest in a silk screen machine.\\nLiam will need to analyze the purchase of a silk screen machine to determine the impact on their business in\\nthe short term as well as the long term, including the accounting implications related to the expense of this\\nmachine. Liam knows that over time, the value of the machine will decrease, but they also know that an asset\\nis supposed to be recorded on the books at its historical cost. They also wonder what costs are considered part\\nof this asset. Additionally, Liam has learned about the matching principle (expense recognition) but needs to\\nlearn how that relates to a machine that is purchased in one year and used for many years to help generate\\nrevenue. Liam has a lot of information to consider before making this decision.\\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item? 111', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Tangible assets can be either short term, such as inventory and supplies, or long term,\\nsuch as land, buildings, and equipment. To be considered a long-term tangible asset, the item needs to be\\nused in the normal operation of the business for more than one year, be of material value, and not be near the\\nend of its useful life, and the company must have no plan to sell the item in the near future. The useful life is\\nthe time period over which an asset cost is allocated. Long-term tangible assets are known as fixed assets. It’s\\nalso key to note that companies will capitalize a fixed asset if they have material value. A $10 stapler to be\\nused in the office, for example, may last for years, but the value of the item is not significant enough to\\nwarrant capitalizing it.\\nBusinesses typically need many different types of these assets to meet their objectives. These assets differ\\nfrom the company’s products. For example, the computers that Apple, Inc. intends to sell are considered\\ninventory (a short-term asset), whereas the computers Apple’s employees use for day-to-day operations are\\nlong-term assets. In Liam’s case, the new silk screen machine would be considered a long-term tangible asset\\nas they plan to use it over many years to help generate revenue for their business. Long-term tangible assets\\nare listed as noncurrent assets on a company’s balance sheet. Typically, these assets are listed under the\\ncategory of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E), but they may be referred to as fixed assets or plant assets.\\nApple, Inc. lists a total of $36.766 million in total Property, Plant, and Equipment (net) on its September 2020\\nconsolidated balance sheet (see Figure 4.7). As shown in the figure, this net total includes land and buildings,\\nmachinery, equipment and internal-use software, and leasehold improvements, resulting in a gross PP&E of\\n$103.526 million—less accumulated depreciation and amortization of $66.760 million—to arrive at the net\\namount of $36.766 million.\\nFigure 4.7 Apple’s Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net (September 2020, in $ million)3 This report shows the company’s\\nconsolidated financial statement details as of September 30, 2020, and September 30, 2019.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nClassifying Assets and Related Expenditures\\nYou work at a business consulting firm.

Let’s return to Liam’s start-up business as an example. Liam\\nplans to buy a silk screen machine to help create clothing that they will sell. The machine is a long-term asset\\nbecause it will be used in the business’s daily operation for many years. If the machine costs Liam $5,000 and it\\nis expected to be used in their business for several years, GAAP require the allocation of the machine’s costs\\nover its useful life, which is the period over which it will produce revenues. Overall, in determining a company’s\\nfinancial performance, we would not expect that Liam should have an expense of $5,000 this year and $0 in\\nexpenses for this machine for future years in which it is being used. GAAP addressed this through the expense\\nrecognition (matching) principle, which states that expenses should be recorded in the same period with the\\nrevenues that the expense helped create. In Liam’s case, the $5,000 for this machine should be allocated over\\nthe years in which it helps to generate revenue for the business. Capitalizing the machine allows this to occur.\\nAs stated previously, to capitalize is to record a long-term asset on the balance sheet and expense its allocated\\ncosts on the income statement over the asset’s economic life. Therefore, when Liam purchases the machine,\\nthey will record it as an asset on the financial statements (see journal entry in Figure 4.8).\\nFigure 4.8 Journal Entry for Machine/Cash\\nWhen capitalizing an asset, the total cost of acquiring the asset is included in the cost of the asset. This\\nincludes additional costs beyond the purchase price, such as shipping costs, taxes, assembly, and legal fees.\\nFor example, if a real estate broker is paid $8,000 as part of a transaction to purchase land for $100,000, the\\nland would be recorded at a cost of $108,000.\\nOver time, as the asset is used to generate revenue, Liam will need to depreciate recognize the cost of the\\nasset.\\n3 In the Chapter 4 financial statements, a number contained within parentheses is a negative number, such as the “Accumulated\\ndepreciation and amortization” line item.\\n4.4 • When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item? 113', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If a long-term asset is used in the business’s\\noperations, it will belong in property, plant, and equipment or intangible assets. In this situation, the asset is\\ntypically capitalized.

For example, if\\na business owns land on which it operates a store, warehouse, factory, or offices, the cost of that land would\\nbe included in property, plant, and equipment. However, if a business owns a vacant piece of land on which\\nthe business conducts no operations (and assuming no current or intermediate-term plans for development),\\nthe land would be considered an investment.\\nDepreciation is the process of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life, or the period of time\\nthat the business believes it will use the asset to help generate revenue.\\nFundamentals of Depreciation\\nAs you have learned, when accounting for a long-term fixed asset, we cannot simply record an expense for the\\ncost of the asset and record the entire outflow of cash in one accounting period. Like all other assets, when\\nyou purchase or acquire a long-term asset, it must be recorded at the historical (initial) cost, which includes all\\ncosts to acquire the asset and put it into use. The initial recording of an asset has two steps:\\n1. Record the initial purchase on the date of purchase, which places the asset on the balance sheet (as\\nproperty, plant, and equipment) at cost, and record the amount as notes payable, accounts payable, or an\\noutflow of cash.\\n2. At the end of the period, make an adjusting entry to recognize the depreciation expense. Depreciation\\nexpense is the amount of the asset’s cost to be recognized, or expensed, in the current period. Companies\\nmay record depreciation expense incurred annually, quarterly, or monthly.\\nFollowing GAAP and the expense recognition principle, the depreciation expense is recognized over the asset’s\\nestimated useful life.\\nRecording the Initial Asset\\nAssets are recorded on the balance sheet at cost, meaning that all costs to purchase the asset and to prepare\\nthe asset for operation should be included. Costs outside of the purchase price may include shipping, taxes,\\ninstallation, and modifications to the asset.\\nThe journal entry to record the purchase of a fixed asset (assuming that a note payable, not a short-term\\naccount payable, is used for financing) is shown in Figure 4.9.\\nFigure 4.9 Journal Entry for Fixed Asset\\nApplying this to Liam’s silk-screening business, we learn that they purchased their silk screen machine for\\n$54,000 by paying $10,000 cash and the remainder in a note payable over five years.

It is common and\\nexpected that the estimates are inaccurate due to the uncertainty involved in estimating the future.\\nSometimes, however, a company may attempt to take advantage of estimating salvage value and useful life\\nto improve earnings. A larger salvage value and longer useful life decrease annual depreciation expense\\nand increase annual net income. An example of this behavior is Waste Management, which was disciplined\\nby the SEC in March 2002 for fraudulently altering its estimates to reduce depreciation expense and\\noverstate net income by $1.7 billion.4\\nComponents Used in Calculating Depreciation\\nThe expense recognition principle that requires that the cost of the asset be allocated over the asset’s useful\\nlife is the process of depreciation. For example, if we buy a delivery truck to use for the next five years, we\\nwould allocate the cost and record depreciation expense across the entire five-year period. The calculation of\\nthe depreciation expense for a period is not based on anticipated changes in the fair-market value of the\\nasset; instead, the depreciation is based on the allocation of the cost of owning the asset over the period of its\\nuseful life.\\nThe following items are important in determining and recording depreciation:\\n• Book value: the asset’s original cost less accumulated depreciation.\\n• Useful life: the length of time the asset will be productively used within operations.\\n• Salvage (residual) value: the price the asset will sell for or be worth as a trade-in when its useful life\\nexpires. The determination of salvage value can be an inexact science since it requires anticipating what\\nwill occur in the future. Often, the salvage value is estimated based on past experiences with similar\\nassets.\\n• Depreciable base (cost): the depreciation expense over the asset’s useful life. For example, if we paid\\n$50,000 for an asset and anticipate a salvage value of $10,000, the depreciable base is $40,000. We expect\\n$40,000 in depreciation over the time period in which the asset was used, and then it would be sold for\\n$10,000.\\nDepreciation records an expense for the value of an asset consumed and removes that portion of the asset\\nfrom the balance sheet. The journal entry to record depreciation is shown in Figure 4.11.\\n4 United States Securities and Exchange Commission. “Waste Management, Inc.

It represents the\\namount of expense being recognized in the current period. Accumulated depreciation, on the other hand,\\nrepresents the sum of all depreciation expense recognized to date, or the total of all prior depreciation\\nexpense for the asset. It is a contra account, meaning it is attached to another account and is used to offset\\nthe main account balance that records the total depreciation expense for a fixed asset over its life. In this case,\\nthe asset account stays recorded at the historical value but is offset on the balance sheet by accumulated\\ndepreciation. Accumulated depreciation is subtracted from the historical cost of the asset on the balance sheet\\nto show the asset at book value. Book value is the amount of the asset that has not been allocated to expense\\nthrough depreciation.\\nIt is important to note, however, that not all long-term assets are depreciated. For example, land is not\\ndepreciated because depreciation is the allocating of the expense of an asset over its useful life. How can one\\ndetermine a useful life for land? It is assumed that land has an unlimited useful life; therefore, it is not\\ndepreciated, and it remains on the books at historical cost.\\nOnce it is determined that depreciation should be accounted for, there are three methods that are most\\ncommonly used to calculate the allocation of depreciation expense: the straight-line method, the units-of-\\nproduction method, and the double-declining-balance method. A fourth method, the sum-of-the-years-digits\\nmethod, is another accelerated option that has been losing popularity and can be learned in intermediate\\naccounting courses.

As an asset\\nsupports the cash flow of the organization, expensing its cost needs to be allocated, not just recorded as an\\narbitrary calculation. An asset’s depreciation may change over its life according to its use. If asset depreciation\\nis arbitrarily determined, the recorded “gains or losses on the disposition of depreciable property assets seen\\nin financial statements”6 are not true best estimates. Due to operational changes, the depreciation expense\\nneeds to be periodically reevaluated and adjusted.\\nAny mischaracterization of asset usage is not proper GAAP and is not proper accrual accounting. Therefore,\\n“financial statement preparers, as well as their accountants and auditors, should pay more attention to the\\nquality of depreciation-related estimates and their possible mischaracterization and losses of credits and\\ncharges to operations as disposal gains.”7 An accountant should always follow GAAP guidelines and allocate\\nthe expense of an asset according to its usage.\\n5 Howard B.

In accounting it is common to present net income in the following format:\\nRecall that revenue is the value of goods and services a business provides to its customers and increases the\\nvalue of the business.

While gains and losses are infrequent in\\na business, it is not uncommon that a business would present a gain and/or loss in its financial statements.\\nRecall that gains are similar to revenue and losses are similar to expenses. Therefore, the traditional\\naccounting format would be as shown in Figure 4.17.\\nFigure 4.17 Gains and Losses\\nShown as a formula, the net income (loss) function, including gains and losses, is:\\nWhen assessing a company’s net income, it is important to understand the source of the net income.\\nBusinesses strive to attain “high quality” net income (earnings). High-quality earnings are based on\\nsustainable earnings, also called permanent earnings, while relying less on infrequent earnings, also called\\ntemporary earnings. Recall that revenues represent the ongoing value of goods and services the business\\nprovides (sells) to its customers, while gains are infrequent and involve items ancillary to the primary purpose\\nof the business. For example, assume a bakery sells the truck it uses to deliver wedding cakes and experiences\\na gain on the sale. The bakery is not in the business of buying and selling trucks. It is in the baked goods\\nbusiness. Thus, the gain on the sale of the truck would be ancillary to the primary purpose of the business and\\nrepresent a gain rather than revenue. We should use caution if a business attains a significant portion of its\\nnet income as a result of gains rather than revenues. Likewise, net losses derived as a result of losses should\\nbe put into the proper perspective due to the infrequent nature of losses. While net losses are undesirable for\\nany reason, net losses that result from expenses related to ongoing operations, rather than losses that are\\ninfrequent, are more concerning for the business.\\nProfit versus Cash Flow\\nKnowing the difference between the cash basis and accrual basis of accounting is necessary to understand the\\nneed for the statement of cash flows. Stakeholders need to know the financial performance (as measured by\\nthe income statement—that is, net income or net loss) and financial position (as measured by the balance\\nsheet—that is, assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity) of the business. This information is provided in the\\nincome statement, statement of owner’s equity, and balance sheet. However, since these financial statements\\nare prepared using accrual accounting, stakeholders do not have a clear picture of the business’s cash\\nactivities. The statement of cash flows solves this inadequacy by specifically focusing on the cash inflows and\\ncash outflows. It also helps better delineate the difference between revenues and cash flow in versus expenses\\nand cash flow out. As mentioned in prior sections, revenue can occur without cash actually flowing.

Accrual-basis\\naccounting, on the other hand, records revenues and expenses when they are earned or incurred rather than\\nwaiting until cash changes hands. Most publicly traded companies are required by the SEC to use accrual-basis\\naccounting. Generally, smaller businesses that deal primarily in cash are the best candidates for using the cash\\nbasis since the accrual method more accurately depicts net income or net loss each period.\\n4.2 Economic Basis for Accrual Accounting\\nDouble-entry accounting means that each time a transaction is recorded, there are at minimum two accounts\\nimpacted by the entry. Each entry’s debits must total its credits in order to support and maintain the balance\\nin the accounting equation. The accounting equation is expressed as\\n4.3 How Does a Company Recognize a Sale and an Expense?\\nIn accrual accounting, the timing of revenues (when to record them) is governed by the revenue recognition\\nprinciple. The principle indicates that revenue is only recognized on the income statement once it is earned.\\nThis means goods or services must have been delivered or rendered. Expenses, on the other hand, are guided\\nby the expense recognition principle, which dictates that expenses must be recorded in the period in which\\nthey are incurred.\\n4.4 When Should a Company Capitalize or Expense an Item?\\nDetermining when an item is actually an expense depends on whether it is capitalized (a fixed asset) or not.\\nFixed assets are those that are of significant value and last longer than one year. The cost of fixed assets is\\ncapitalized (placed on the balance sheet as an asset) and expensed over the useful life of the asset by\\nrecording depreciation. Depreciation can be calculated using straight-line, double-declining-balance, or units-\\nof-production methods.\\n4.5 What Is “Profit” versus “Loss” for the Company?\\nProfit or loss for a company is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenue. The result is a profit if\\nrevenues are larger than expenses. Profit (or loss) is the money earned from the day-to-day general business\\noperations.

These\\nstatements are the income statement, balance sheet, statement of owner’s equity, and statement of cash\\nflows. Each statement provides different insights into a firm’s performance and financial health. Though some\\nusers may favor one or two statements over another, they are best used together to get a full picture.\\nIn this chapter, you’ll be introduced to a firm called Clear Lake Sporting Goods. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a\\nsmall merchandising company (a company that buys finished goods and sells them to consumers) that sells\\nhunting and fishing gear. It needs financial statements to understand its profitability and current financial\\nposition, manage cash flow, and communicate its finances to outside parties like investors, governing bodies,\\nand lenders.

Thus, the statements are prepared in a\\nspecific order. The first statement prepared is the income statement.\\nFunctionality of the Income Statement\\nThe income statement shows a firm’s performance over a specific period of time. The statement helps\\nfinancial statement users understand the sales generated during the period and the expenses incurred to\\ngenerate those sales. If the expenses are smaller than the sales, the net result is profitability, or net income,\\nrather than a net loss.\\nBreaking the income statement down into smaller pieces provides a more transparent view of the firm’s\\nperformance, allowing users to see more clearly what areas of the business incurred expenses. This is helpful\\nto management in driving improvements and to outside users in assessing performance.\\nSales and Gross Profit\\nThe first section of the income statement begins with sales. Though financial statements are required to follow\\na certain format, account names can differ slightly from one firm to another. You may see the first line, often\\nreferred to as the top line, called sales, sales revenue, revenue, service revenues, and other similar titles. All of\\nthese titles are meant to reflect the sales generated by selling product to customers in the day-to-day\\nbusiness. On Clear Lake’s income statement in Figure 5.2, we see its top line referred to as Sales.\\nIncome from items that aren’t common to the firm’s day-to-day business are reported as gains and losses,\\nand they are reported further down in the income statement rather than at the top line with its regular, core\\nbusiness activities. This is to ensure that anomalies like selling a machine or a loss on retiring a bond don’t\\nmislead financial statement users as to the general performance of the firm and impact their assumptions of\\nfuture results.\\nFirms report their sales and any reductions to sales separately on the income statement. They begin with\\ngross sales, which includes all sales to customers. Clear Lake reported gross sales of $105,000 last year and\\n$126,000 this year. The next line is sales returns and allowances, which is deducted from gross sales in order to\\nfind net sales. Clear Lake’s sales returns and allowances were $5,000 and $6,000 respectively, leaving the\\ncompany with net sales of $100,000 and $120,000 respectively\\nNext, the cost of goods sold (COGS) is deducted from net sales in order to arrive at gross profit. (It is\\ncustomary to refer to sales minus COGS as gross profit because gross margin gross profit/sales.) Cost of\\ngoods sold includes the costs directly involved in making the product that was sold during the period.\\nCommon examples of costs included in cost of goods sold include direct labor, direct materials, and the\\noverhead assigned to the product in production. For a service business, this would include its direct labor and\\nany materials used to deliver its services. For a retail firm like Clear Lake Sporting Goods, this would include\\nthe costs of all the goods it purchased for resale. Clear Lake’s COGS is seen at $50,000 and $60,000 for the\\nprior and current years. Note that different types of companies will have different types of costs deducted in\\ntheir Cost of Goods section. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a retailer, or merchandiser that buys good to resell.\\nTheir cost of goods includes the cost of goods they purchased to resell.

After\\ngross profit is calculated, other operating expenses are deducted in order to calculate the firm’s income from\\noperations, also commonly called operating income. Common operating costs found in this section include\\nbuilding rent and utilities, property taxes, wages and salaries, and other overhead costs. In Figure 5.3, we can\\nsee Clear Lake’s operating expenses.

The classified\\nbalance sheet shows the financial state of a company as of a specific point in time. It is a key distinction\\nbetween the two statements. The classified balance sheet is prepared in sections that align with the\\naccounting equation.\\nRemember, the accounting equation reflects the assets (items owned by the organization) and how they\\nwere obtained (by incurring liabilities or provided by owners). Liabilities are debts owed to other parties.\\nStated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by creditors and/or owners.\\nThe classified balance sheet is thus broken down into three sections; assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity.

Both assets\\nand liabilities are broken down on the balance sheet into current and noncurrent classifications in order to\\nprovide more detail and transparency as well as abide by the convention of reporting in descending order of\\nliquidity. Current assets are those that can be used or converted to cash within a year. Common examples of\\ncurrent assets include cash, inventory, accounts receivable, and short-term investments. Assets that will be in\\nuse longer than a year are considered noncurrent. Common examples of noncurrent assets include notes\\nreceivable, machinery and equipment, buildings, and land.\\nJust as we noted a few key differences in the income statements based on the type of firm, you may also notice\\na few slight differences in the balance sheet depending on the firm type. Clear Lake Sporting Goods is a\\nretailer. Thus, you will see that their inventory for resale on their balance sheet is simply called “Inventory.”\\nThis is the goods they have purchased for resale but have not yet sold. A manufacturer, like Apple, Inc. in the\\nLink to Learning sections, will have a variety of inventory types including raw materials, work in progress, and\\nfinished goods inventory. These represent the various states of the inventory (ready to use, partially complete,\\nand fully completed product). A service firm, on the other hand, may not have inventory at all. If it does, it may\\nbe simple goods it uses to help deliver its service. For example, a cleaning company may keep an inventory of\\ncleaning supplies.\\nFigure 5.6 Graphical Representation of the Accounting Equation Both assets and liabilities are categorized as current and\\nnoncurrent.\\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has cash, accounts receivable, inventory, short-term investments, and equipment.\\nIt rents its facilities, so it has no buildings on its balance sheets.

Common examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, wages payable, and\\nunearned revenue. Noncurrent liabilities are those that are due more than a year into the future. Notes\\npayable is a common noncurrent liability.\\nClear Lake Sporting Goods has accounts payable and has collected payments from a few customers that it\\nhasn’t yet shipped its product to (unearned revenue). It also owes money on a note payable. Its accounts\\npayable and unearned revenue are both current liabilities. The note payable is not due for several years, thus\\nmaking it a noncurrent liability (see Figure 5.8).\\nFigure 5.8 Liability Section of Classified Balance Sheet\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nCurrent and Noncurrent Liabilities\\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

What is the amount of the\\ncompany’s total assets for the most recent year? What is the amount of its total liabilities and equity?\\nSolution:\\nApple’s total assets for 2020 were $323,888, and its total liabilities and equity were also $323,888. (Amounts\\nare in millions.)\\nImportance of the Balance Sheet\\nNow that we have gone to all the work to carefully assemble a classified balance sheet, what do we use it for?\\nThe answer lies within the accounting equation itself. Think of the accounting equation from a “sources and\\nclaims” perspective. Under this approach, the assets (items owned by the organization) were obtained by\\nincurring liabilities or were provided by owners. Stated differently, every asset has a claim against it—by\\ncreditors and/or owners. The balance sheet shows us what the firm has (its assets), who owns them (equity),\\nand who the firm owes (its liabilities).\\nLimitations of the Balance Sheet\\nThe balance sheet is indeed a very helpful financial statement, but it also poses challenges. First, assets on the\\nbalance sheet, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), are recorded at historical cost.\\nHistorical cost is simply the cost paid for the item at the time it was purchased. Changes in market value of big-\\nticket items like land or buildings are not reflected in the balance sheet. Land remains at historical cost, and\\ndepreciable items like buildings are reflected at their current book value (historical cost less accumulated\\ndepreciation). If the asset has appreciated over time, the higher market value of the assets would not be seen\\non the balance sheet.\\nEstimates are another limitation of the balance sheet. Items on the balance sheet such as allowance for\\ndoubtful accounts and allowance for bad debt are based on estimates. The useful lives for calculating\\ndepreciation is another common estimate. If these estimates are incorrect, the net value of the asset can be\\nunder- or overstated.\\nAnother key limitation is the fact that a balance sheet reflects balances at only one given point in time.

Thus, on\\nDecember 31, the firm reflects a high cash balance on its balance sheet. However, by the end of the first week\\nof January, it has caught up on late vendor payments and again shows a low cash balance.\\nFinally, there are many possible things of value that are not recorded on the balance sheet. Internally\\ngenerated assets and the firm’s human capital are two common examples. Internally generated assets can be\\nanything from a website, a process, to an idea.\\n5.3 The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Identify connected elements between the balance sheet and the income statement.\\n• Differentiate between expenses and payables.\\nNet Income and Retained Earnings\\nAs mentioned earlier, the financial statements are linked by certain elements and thus must be prepared in a\\ncertain order. The income statement was first since net income (or loss) is a required figure in preparing the\\nbalance sheet. During the period close process, all temporary accounts are closed to the income summary\\naccount, which is then closed to retained earnings. All revenue and expense accounts are closed since they are\\ntemporary. The net result is either net profit or net loss as the balance in the income summary account.\\nRemember that the retained earnings account reflects all income the firm has earned since its inception less\\nany dividends paid out to shareholders. Thus the result (net income) of the income statement feeds the\\nretained earnings account on the balance sheet. Retained earnings is also an element of the statement of\\nstockholders’ equity, which we will cover later in this chapter.\\nIn Figure 5.10, we see net income in the current year of $35,000, which was added to the company’s prior year\\nretained earnings balance of $15,000. Notice, however, that the prior year balance was $15,000, and the\\ncurrent year balance is only $20,000. It does not total $50,000 as we might have expected.\\nRemember, retained earnings represents all earnings since inception less any dividends paid out. Clear Lake\\nSporting Goods must have paid out $30,000 in dividends in the current year. We will see this information laid\\nout in the statement of retained earnings. In the prior year they began with a $10,000 balance in retained\\nearnings. Income of $30,000 increased retained earnings and dividends paid back out to investors reduced\\nretained earnings, leaving an ending balance in the prior year of $15,000. This rolls over and is the beginning\\nbalance for the current year. In the current year Clear Lake had net income of $35,000 and paid $30,000 of\\ntheir earnings out to shareholders, essentially resulting in a $5,000 increase to the retained earnings account.\\nFigure 5.10 Statement of Retained Earnings\\nNow we can see the full flow of information from the income statement to the statement of retained earnings\\n(Figure 5.10) and finally to the balance sheet.

The two are often assumed to be the same thing. However,\\nit is important to note that the two are distinctly different.\\nLet’s look at an example to outline the key differences. Clear Lake Sporting Goods incurred utility expenses\\nduring the current period (electric and gas). Its utilities totaled $1,500. In the month that followed, the utilities\\nvendor sent an invoice for $1,500. Clear Lake has incurred an expense. It will reflect an expense of $1,500 on\\nthe income statement for the utilities expense. This is the income statement impact of the transaction. So is it\\nsafe to assume that because Clear Lake has an expense, it also used cash? Not necessarily. Or is it safe to\\nassume that if the company has an expense, it is the same as a payable? Again, the answer is no.\\nRemember, the accounting equation rests on the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. This\\nmeans that every transaction has two sides: a debit and a credit. They must be equal. When Clear Lake records\\nan expense of $1,500, it must also record the other half of that transaction. In this case, the company incurred\\nutilities expenses throughout the period “on account,” which means it records an increase in their accounts\\npayable. When the invoice comes due, another transaction must then be recorded to reduce accounts payable\\nand reduce cash. Accounts payable is a liability found on the balance sheet, normally a current liability. The\\nexpense incurred caused the payable, but it is distinctly separate from the payable (see Figure 5.12).\\nFigure 5.12 Connections between Expenses and Accounts Payable\\n140 5 • Financial Statements\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The statement of owner’s equity addresses the last segment of the accounting\\nequation in detail by laying out the equity elements of the firm and highlighting changes in these elements\\nthroughout the period.\\nEquity represents the ownership of the firm. The stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet for\\ncorporations contains two primary categories of accounts. The first is paid-in capital or contributed\\ncapital—consisting of amounts paid in by owners. The second category is earned capital, consisting of\\namounts earned by the corporation as part of business operations. On the balance sheet, retained earnings is\\na key component of the earned capital section, while the stock accounts such as common stock, preferred\\nstock, and additional paid-in capital are the primary components of the contributed capital section.\\nCommon stock represents ownership in the firm. Common stockholders normally have voting rights.\\nPreferred stock has unique rights that are “preferred,” or more advantageous, to shareholders than common\\nstock. Unlike common stockholders, preferred shareholders typically do not have voting rights and do not\\nshare in the common stock dividend distributions. Instead, the “preferred” classification entitles shareholders\\nto a dividend that is fixed (assuming sufficient dividends are declared). Treasury stock is shares that were\\noutstanding and have been repurchased by the firm but not retired. Thus they are still issued, but not\\noutstanding. Additional paid-in capital is the difference between the issue price and par value of the common\\nstock. For example, if a firm issued and sold stock at a market price of $20 that had a $5 par value, $5 for each\\nshare would be recorded into common stock and the excess $15 per share would be recorded into the\\nadditional paid-in capital account.\\nIf we review the balance sheet for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we see just two elements of equity: common\\nstock and retained earnings. Common stock in the prior year was $75,000 and increased to $80,000 in the\\ncurrent year, indicating Clear Lake issued additional common stock (see Figure 5.13).\\nFigure 5.13 Stockholder Equity Section of Balance Sheet\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nEquity Accounts\\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

What types of equity accounts does it report?\\nSolution:\\nApple reports common stock, retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income.\\nDistributions to Owners\\nWhen firms earn a profit, they have two options as to what to do with their earnings. They can keep (retain)\\nthem and reinvest them back into the business, or they can pay them out to their shareholders in the form of\\ndividends. Dividends are commonly in the form of cash, but dividends can be paid out in the form of stock or\\nother assets as well.\\nTo pay a cash dividend, the firm must have enough cash on hand and sufficient retained earnings. They cannot\\npay out a dividend beyond the retained earnings available. Some companies issue shares of stock as a\\ndividend rather than cash or property. This often occurs when the company has insufficient cash but wants to\\nkeep its investors happy. When a company issues a stock dividend, it distributes additional shares of stock to\\nexisting shareholders.\\nA property dividend occurs when the firm pays out dividends in the form of something other than stock or\\ncash, often one of their assets or something they hold in inventory. For example, Walt Disney Company may\\nchoose to distribute tickets to visit its theme parks. A property dividend may be declared when a company\\nwants to reward its investors but doesn’t have the cash to distribute, or if it needs to hold on to its existing\\ncash for other investments.\\nRemember, the retained earnings account reflects the cumulative earnings of a firm since they began\\nbusiness, less dividends paid out to shareholders. This includes all forms of dividends (cash, stock, and other\\nassets). Note that dividends are distributed or paid only to shares of stock that are outstanding. Treasury\\nshares are not outstanding, so no dividends are declared or distributed for these shares. Regardless of the\\ntype of dividend, the declaration always causes a decrease in the retained earnings account.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nDividends\\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

It is a crucial statement, as it shows the sources of\\nand uses of cash for the firm during the accounting period. Remember, under accrual accounting, transactions\\nare recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. Thus, the income statement does not provide\\nall the insights necessary to understand a firm’s cash flows. To fully understand the firm’s flow of cash, the\\nstatement of cash flows is needed.\\nImportance of the Statement of Cash Flows\\nRemember, most firms use accrual accounting. Revenues and expenses are recorded when they occur, not\\nnecessarily when cash moves. This can create timing differences between profits and cash flows. A firm can be\\nprofitable and still not have an adequate flow of cash. The opposite is also true: it can experience a net loss\\nand still have cash on hand. Earning a profit is wonderful, but it is not the only goal an organization has. It\\nmust also have adequate cash flow to support daily operations. To support cash planning and to provide\\nexternal financial statement users such as lenders and investors information about the firm’s cash flow, the\\nstatement of cash flows is prepared. Cash flow is also a crucial metric for determining the value of a company.\\nExternal financial statement users also rely on the statement of cash flows to help them evaluate the quality of\\nthe firm’s earnings. Users compare earnings to cash flow to assess the validity of the earnings data. For\\nexample, a firm reporting a strong profit but very little cash flow might raise some questions as to what was\\nrecorded to drive profits that isn’t also driving cash flows.\\nThe statement of cash flows also helps external users determine the driving forces behind the firm’s cash\\nflows. They can see if cash is generated primarily by daily operations or if cash is being generated or\\n5.5 • The Statement of Cash Flows 143', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

FASB (Financial Accounting\\nStandards Board) favors the direct method. Despite that, the most common method used by far in general\\npractice is the indirect method. The direct method lists cash flows directly from revenues and expenses,\\nwhereas the indirect method reconciles income to cash flows. The indirect method begins with net income and\\nreconciles each account in order to arrive at net cash flow. It essentially reconciles accrual basis accounting to\\ncash basis, or cash flow.\\nOperating Activities\\nTo provide clear information about what areas of the business generated and used cash, the statement of cash\\nflows is broken down into three key categories: operating, financing, and investing. The operating section\\nreflects cash flows generated by and used by the day-to-day operations of the business. Investing activities\\ninclude investments in other firms as well as investments in the firm itself (items like machinery, land, or other\\nfixed assets). Finally, financing activities are those used to provide funds to run the business (loans, interest).\\nAs mentioned, operating activities are those that are used or generated by the day-to-day operations of the\\nfirm. The operating activities section of the statement of cash flows begins with net income. All lines\\nthereafter, in that section, are then adjustments to reconcile net income to actual cash flows by adding back\\nnoncash expenses like depreciation and adjusting for changes in asset and liability accounts. For example,\\ndepreciation is a noncash expense. Thus, depreciation is added back to net income.\\nTo prepare the statement of cash flows for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we need the beginning cash balance\\nfrom the balance sheet, net income and depreciation expense from the income statement, and a set of\\ncomparative balance sheets to see the change in asset and liability accounts (see Figure 5.15).\\n144 5 • Financial Statements\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Next, noncash expenses are deducted. Clear Lake’s only noncash expense on their current year\\nincome statement is depreciation of $3,600. Since deprecation is an expense that reduces income but is not\\nactually paid out in cash in the current period, it must be added back to net income to reconcile net income to\\ncash flow.\\nNext, changes in operational assets and liabilities are used to continue reconciling net income to actual cash\\nflow. For example, Clear Lake’s accounts receivable increased from the prior period to the current period. This\\nmeans that there were more sales recorded but not yet received in cash in this period than there were in the\\nprior period, making an increase in accounts receivable a reduction on the statement. Inventory increased,\\nwhich means additional cash was spent to acquire it, making it a use of cash or reduction to net income to\\nmove closer to cash.

Operating cash flow, or net cash flow from\\noperating activities, is calculated in the first section of the statement of cash flows. It depicts the cash\\ngenerated (or used by) the primary business activities. Remember, operating cash flow is calculated under the\\nindirect method by adjusting net income for noncash expenses like depreciation and adjustments for changes\\nin current asset and liability accounts (changes in working capital).\\nOperating cash flow is helpful in assessing organizational cash management performance as it relates to the\\ncore business function—operations. Key management practices in this area can have a profound impact on\\nthe firm’s cash flow. Practices and policies include customer payment terms, collection policies and practices,\\nand vendor payment terms. Though changing a customer or vendor payment terms will not change the profit\\nor loss for the firm, it will have an impact on the timing to cash flows. This is a key element of managing\\noperational cash flow.\\nFree Cash Flow\\nFree cash flow (FCF) is calculated by taking operating cash flows less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is an\\nimportant measure, as it depicts the cash available to support the business’s operations and maintain its fixed\\nassets. It is commonly used by investors as part of their overall evaluation of an investment, as it is a key\\nmeasure of cash flow management practices and a firm’s ability to generate enough cash to cover operations\\nand capital assets and it shows if there is any left over for other considerations such as dividend payments,\\ndebt repayment, and contributions to increase working capital for future growth.\\nUsing the data for Clear Lake Sporting Goods, we can calculate its free cash flow as follows:\\nThis means that Clear Lake Sporting Goods has $40,000 of cash available to repay debt or pay cash dividends\\nafter having covered the cash needs of its operations and capital asset investments.\\nManaging Cash Flow\\nManaging cash flow is not an easy task. A firm has a myriad of places that its cash flows from or to. However,\\nthere are a few key areas to place attention in order to manage or improve cash flows. First, consider where\\ncash is coming from—customers. Managing terms and collection efforts with customers can have a significant\\nimpact on a firm’s cash flow. For example, a customer with terms of net 10 will likely yield payment quite\\nquickly—10 days, give or take. A customer with terms of net 60, on the other hand, will require roughly 60 days\\nto collect assuming they pay on time. The 50-day difference between these two examples means that the firm\\nwill go 50 additional days having expended the resources to provide the customer their good or service, but\\nwith no cash flow yet to cover it.\\nThe same theory holds true on the opposite side with accounts payable and the vendors a firm uses.

Some customers may not have difficulty negotiating a more favorable\\npayment term in order for the firm to improve its cash flow. Others, however, may not be willing to accept\\nshorter payment terms. In order to be competitive in the industry, the firm must assess the customer\\nrelationships, industry standards, and its own ability to support cash flow when considering its customer\\npayment terms.\\nWhen there is a gap in cash flow, it is crucial that it is recognized early, with proper cash flow forecasting, so\\nfinancing can be obtained to bridge the gap. A common tool used to manage the ebb and flow of cash flow for\\na firm is an open line of credit with a bank. This allows the firm to borrow and repay from month to month as\\ncash flow fluctuates.\\nNow that you’ve become more familiar with the four basic financial statements, let’s move on to a tool helpful\\nin evaluating them: common-size statements. Common-size financial statements, also termed vertical analysis,\\nrestate the financial statement items as a percentage of a base item.

Expressing\\neach item on the income statement as a percentage rather than in absolute dollars makes it much easier to\\nmake comparisons, particularly to other divisions or competitors of varying sizes.

The mix of current assets that comprise\\nthat 80 percent changed only slightly with a 1 percent decrease in cash, 2 percent increase in accounts\\nreceivable, 2 percent decrease in inventory, and no change in short-term investments.

While the balance in the equipment account did change as a percentage of total\\nassets, equipment remained the same at 20 percent.\\nOn the debt and equity side of the balance sheet, however, there were a few percentage changes worth\\nnoting. In the prior year, the balance sheet reflected 55 percent debt and 45 percent equity. In the current\\nyear, that balance shifted to 60 percent debt and 40 percent equity. The firm did issue additional stock and\\nshowed an increase in retained earnings, both totaling a $10,000 increase in equity. However, the equity\\nincrease was much smaller than the total increase in liabilities of $40,000. Long-term debt increased by only\\n$10,000 by issuing additional notes payable. The remainder of that increase is seen in the 5 percent increase in\\ncurrent liabilities. In that increase, most of it was in unearned revenue.\\n5.7 • Common-Size Statements 153', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Charlie is a much bigger retailer for outdoor gear, as\\nCharlie has nearly seven times greater sales than Clear Lake. Common-size statements allow Clear Lake to\\ncompare their statements in a meaningful way (see Figure 5.26). Notice that Clear Lake spends 50 percent of\\nits sales on cost of goods sold while Charlie spends 59 percent.

Accounting periods are important, particularly in accrual accounting, so there are clear\\ncutoffs for recording transactions.\\nIt is important to note that Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) require companies to provide\\nquarterly financial statements. However, most firms, even those not covered by GAAP, prepare financial\\nstatements monthly in order to provide timely data to their financial statement users both internally and\\nexternally.\\nTime Period Principle\\nProviding information to financial statement users in a timely fashion brings us to our next key topic, which is\\nthe time period principle. In order for information to be useful, it must be timely. This means that financial\\nstatement users need to get the statements quickly enough to be able to make relevant decisions with them.\\nProviding statements on a timely basis is the foundation of the time period accounting principle.\\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\\nThough a firm may present financial statements monthly, quarterly, and annually, not all time periods are\\ncreated equal. Firms have the option to choose between a fiscal and a calendar year. The calendar year, which\\nbegins January 1 and ends December 31, is the traditional year we are accustomed to. The calendar year,\\nhowever, doesn’t always work well with a firm’s business cycle. Due to seasonality or other factors, a firm may\\nchoose to adopt a fiscal year with their own beginning and end date. For example, a firm may choose to start\\nits fiscal year on June 1 and end it on May 31. A firm can opt to change from a fiscal to a calendar year or vice\\nversa but must only do so for a justifiable reason.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nFiscal versus Calendar Year\\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

A few key items of note might include risk factors, financial statements, the MD&A letter,\\nand disclosures about market risk. Apple’s MD&A reported significant updates on the impact of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, a few financial updates, product updates, segment performance data, a conversation\\nabout its debt, contractual obligations, and accounting policies.\\nSEC Reporting Requirements\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded firms to regularly provide several\\nreports. The two most common are the 10-K and quarterly report (10-Q). Certain unique events also require an\\nadditional filing called an 8-K. There are many events that might require reporting. A few key examples include\\nchanges to rights of shareholders, changes in control of the company, and amendments to the company\\ncharter or bylaws.\\nThe quarterly report is much like the annual report already discussed. It contains the firm’s financial\\nstatements, required accounting disclosures, statements on internal control, and a management discussion\\nand analysis (MD&A) letter. It does not contain an auditor’s report, as firms are not audited on a quarterly\\nbasis. Quarterly reports are helpful to investors because they provide information on a timely enough basis to\\nbe relevant.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nInvestor Relations\\nVisit the Apple, Inc.

Most financial statements are\\nprepared monthly, quarterly, and annually. The income statement reflects sales less cost of goods sold to\\narrive at gross profit. Operating costs are deducted to arrive at operating income. Finally, other\\nnonoperational costs like interest and taxes are deducted to arrive at net income.\\n5.2 The Balance Sheet\\nThe balance sheet reflects the financial position of a firm as of a particular point in time. It is laid out to clearly\\ndepict and support the accounting equation: A classified balance\\nsheet breaks down the assets and liabilities sections into current and noncurrent for greater transparency.\\n5.3 The Relationship between the Balance Sheet and the Income Statement\\nThe financial statements are all tied together. The income statement is generated first, as net income is\\nneeded in order to determine the ending balance of retained earnings, a key account in the equity section of\\nthe balance sheet.\\n5.4 The Statement of Owner’s Equity\\nThe statement of owner’s equity is divided by each type of equity the firm has: common stock, preferred stock,\\nadditional paid-in capital, and retained earnings, for example. Beginning balances are provided, and all key\\ntransactions impacting equity are provided in order to show how ending balance were derived. Key\\ntransactions commonly include recording net income or loss, issuing additional stock, and paying out\\ndividends.\\n5.5 The Statement of Cash Flows\\nUnder accrual accounting, transactions are recorded when they occur, not necessarily when cash moves. This\\ncreates a timing difference. Net profit, therefore, does not necessarily mean a firm has cash, and a net loss\\ndoesn’t mean they don’t have any cash. To reconcile net income to actual cash flow and see how a firm\\ngenerates and uses its funds, a statement of cash flows is prepared. The statement reflects cash flow from\\noperating activities, financing activities, and investing activities.\\n5.6 Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)\\nOperating cash flow reflects the cash generated by (or used by) the core business function. Free cash flow to\\nthe firm (FCFF) or simply free cash flow (FCF) is calculated by deducting capital expenditures from operating\\ncash flow. FCF reflects the cash available to repay debts, pay dividends to shareholders, and contribute to cash\\nneeds for growth.\\n5.7 Common-Size Statements\\nCommon-size statements are a restatement of the financial statements with all dollar figures restated as a\\npercentage. On the income statement, each line is restated as a percentage of net sales. On the balance sheet,\\neach line is restated as a percentage of total assets. Common-size statements are useful for analysis and are\\nparticularly helpful in comparing firms of different sizes.\\n5.8 Reporting Financial Activity\\nPublicly traded firms must file company and financial data with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\\non a regular basis. Key reports include the quarterly report, called a 10-Q, and the annual report, called a 10-K.\\n158 5 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It differs\\ndepending on the role and perspective of those performing the analysis. For example, your personal\\naccountant will have different goals and needs in making recommendations to you about your personal\\nfinances. All accounting professionals use financial analysis to check for validity, accurate data, compliance in\\nreporting, and more.\\nSome tactics for managing your personal finances can be the same as for managing business finances. For\\nexample, reducing expenses and maximizing returns on long-term investments are always good practices.\\nDebt can also be a beneficial tool in both personal and professional finances when used appropriately. Debt is\\nneither inherently good nor bad; it simply needs to be properly managed in order to achieve a reasonable\\nreturn in exchange for the cost and risk it poses.\\nThough the process and tools may be similar, financial analysis from a business perspective has different goals\\nand needs. Investors are looking to identify firm performance, financial health, and profitability. Financial\\nanalysts closely review information found on financial statements so they can make informed business\\ndecisions. The income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows,\\namong other financial information, are analyzed for internal and external stakeholders and provide a company\\nwith valuable information about its overall performance and specific areas for improvement.

One of these roles is that of a financial\\nanalyst. The skills and qualifications of a financial analyst vary widely from one industry to another, but\\nthere are a number of similarities in individuals who hold these roles. As you watch the video about\\nfinancial analysts (https://openstax.org/r/video-about-financial-analysts), consider your own career path\\nand how your skills, abilities, and interests may fit this role.\\n6.1 Ratios: Condensing Information into Smaller Pieces\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the importance of financial statement analysis in making informed decisions about business\\nopportunities.\\n• Outline the limitations of financial statement analysis in making investment decisions.\\nWhen considering the outcomes from analysis, it is important for a company to understand that the data\\ngenerated needs to be compared to similar data within the industry at large as well as that of close\\ncompetitors. The company should also consider its past experience and how it corresponds to current and\\nfuture performance expectations.\\nImportance of Ratios and Analysis\\nFinancial ratios help internal and external stakeholders make informed decisions about actions like investing,\\nbecoming a supplier, making a loan, or altering internal operations, among other things. The information\\nresulting from ratio analysis can be used to examine trends in performance, establish benchmarks for success,\\nset budget expectations, and compare industry competitors. There are four main types of ratios: liquidity,\\nsolvency, efficiency, and profitability. While outcomes for some ratios may seem more ideal, the industry in\\nwhich the business operates can change the influence of these outcomes on stakeholder decisions.\\nThere are several benefits to analyzing financial statements. The information can show trends over time, which\\ncan help in making future business decisions. Converting information to percentages or ratios eliminates\\nsome of the disparities between competitors’ sizes and operating abilities, making it easier for stakeholders to\\nmake informed decisions. It can assist with understanding the makeup of current operations within the\\nbusiness and which shifts need to occur internally to increase productivity.\\nLimitation of Financial Statement Analysis\\nThough useful, it’s important to note that there are limitations to financial statement analysis as well.\\nStakeholders need to remember that past performance does not always predict future performance. Economic\\ninfluences, such as inflation or a recession, could skew the data being analyzed. Additionally, the way a\\ncompany reports information may change over time. For example, there could be changes in where and when\\ncertain transactions are recorded, and this may not be immediately evident to financial statement users. It is\\nalso key to note that though all publicly traded companies in the United States are required to follow Generally\\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), there are many estimates and flexibility in how some standards are\\napplied. This means that firms can still follow accounting standards appropriately but present some\\ninformation differently from other firms.\\nIt makes good sense for a company to use financial statement analysis to guide future operations so it can\\n166 6 • Measures of Financial Health\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The operating cycle includes the cash conversion cycle plus the\\naccounts receivable cycle (discussed below). Essentially it is the time it takes a business to purchase or make\\ninventory and then sell it. For example, assume Clear Lake Sporting Goods orders and receives a shipment of\\nfishing lures on June 1. It stocks the shelves with lures and tracks its inventory and sales. By July 15, all the\\nlures from that shipment are gone. In this example, Clear Lake’s operating cycle is 45 days.\\nCash Conversion Cycle\\nCash, however, doesn’t necessarily flow linearly with accounting periods or operating cycles. The cash\\nconversion cycle is the time it takes to spend cash to purchase inventory, produce the product, sell it, and then\\ncollect cash from the customer. Accounts receivable is one section of that cycle. Referring to Clear Lake’s June\\n1 shipment of lures that sold by July 15, assume that some of the customers were fishing guides that keep an\\nopen account with Clear Lake. This company did not pay for its lures until August 15 when it settled its\\naccount. In this example, Clear Lake’s cash cycle is 75 days.\\nLet’s take a look at the accounts receivable turnover ratio, which helps assess that element of the cash\\nconversion cycle.\\nAccounts Receivable Turnover Ratio\\nReceivables ratios show company performance in relation to current receivables (what is due from customers),\\nas well as credit policy effect on sales growth. One receivables ratio is called the accounts receivable\\nturnover ratio.This ratio determines how many times (i.e., how often) accounts receivable are collected\\nduring a year and converted to cash. A higher number of times indicates that receivables are collected quickly.\\nThis quick cash collection may be viewed as a positive occurrence because liquidity improves, and the\\ncompany may reinvest in its business sooner when the value of the dollar has more buying power (time value\\nof money). The higher number of times may also be a negative occurrence, signaling that credit extension\\nterms are too tight, and it may exclude qualified consumers from purchasing. Excluding these customers\\nmeans that they may take their business to a competitor, thus reducing potential sales.\\nIn contrast, a lower number of times indicates that receivables are collected at a slower rate. A slower\\ncollection rate could signal that lending terms are too lenient; management might consider tightening lending\\nopportunities and more aggressively pursuing payment from its customers. The lower turnover also shows\\nthat the company has cash tied up in receivables longer, thus hindering its ability to reinvest this cash in other\\ncurrent projects. The lower turnover rate may signal a high level of bad debt accounts. The determination of a\\nhigh or low turnover rate really depends on the standards of the company’s industry. It’s key to note the\\ntradeoff in adjusting credit terms. Loose credit terms may attract more customers but may also increase bad\\ndebt expense. Tighter credit terms may attract fewer customers but may also reduce bad debt expense.\\nThe formula for accounts receivable turnover is\\nNet credit sales are sales made on credit only; cash sales are not included because they do not produce\\nreceivables. However, many companies do not report credit sales separately from cash sales, so “net sales”\\nmay be substituted for “net credit sales” in this case. Beginning and ending accounts receivable refer to the\\n168 6 • Measures of Financial Health\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Examples of the most liquid assets include\\ncash, accounts receivable, and inventory for merchandising or manufacturing businesses. The reason these\\nare among the most liquid assets is that these assets will be turned into cash more quickly than land or\\nbuildings, for example. Accounts receivable represents goods or services that have already been sold and will\\ntypically be paid/collected within 30 to 45 days.\\nInventory is less liquid than accounts receivable because the product must first be sold before it generates\\ncash (either through a cash sale or sale on account). Inventory is, however, more liquid than land or buildings\\nbecause, under most circumstances, it is easier and quicker for a business to find someone to purchase its\\ngoods than it is to find a buyer for land or buildings.\\nCurrent Ratio\\nThe current ratio is closely related to working capital; it represents the current assets divided by current\\nliabilities. The current ratio utilizes the same amounts as working capital (current assets and current liabilities)\\nbut presents the amount in ratio, rather than dollar, form. That is, the current ratio is defined as current\\nassets/current liabilities. The interpretation of the current ratio is similar to working capital. A ratio of greater\\nthan one indicates that the firm has the ability to meet short-term obligations with a buffer, while a ratio of\\nless than one indicates that the firm should pay close attention to the composition of its current assets as well\\nas the timing of the current liabilities.\\nThe current ratio in the current year for Clear Lake Sporting Goods is\\nA 2:1 ratio means the company has twice as many current assets as current liabilities; typically, this would be\\nplenty to cover obligations. A 2:1 ratio is actually quite high for most companies and most industries. Again,\\nit’s recommended that ratios be used in conjunction with one another. An analyst would likely look at the high\\ncurrent ratio and low accounts receivable turnover to begin asking questions about management\\nperformance, as this might indicate a trouble area (high inventory and slow collections).\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nTarget Corporation\\nAs we have learned, the current ratio shows how well a company can cover short-term liabilities with short-\\nterm assets.

Both the balance\\nsheet and income statement are needed to calculate earnings per share. The balance sheet provides details on\\nthe preferred dividend rate, the total par value of the preferred stock, and the number of common shares\\noutstanding. The income statement indicates the net income for the period. The formula to calculate basic\\nearnings per share is\\nBy removing the preferred dividends from net income, the numerator represents the profit available to\\ncommon shareholders. Because preferred dividends represent the amount of net income to be distributed to\\npreferred shareholders, this portion of the income is obviously not available for common shareholders. While\\na number of variations of measuring a company’s profit, such as NOPAT (net operating profit after taxes) and\\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), are used in the financial world, GAAP\\nrequires companies to calculate earnings per share based on a corporation’s net income, as this amount\\nappears directly on a company’s income statement, which for public companies must be audited.\\nIn the denominator, only common shares are used to determine earnings per share because earnings per\\nshare is a measure of earnings for each common share of stock. The denominator can fluctuate throughout\\nthe year as a company issues and buys back shares of its own stock. The weighted average number of shares\\nis used on the denominator because of this fluctuation. To illustrate, assume that a corporation began the year\\nwith 600 shares of common stock outstanding and then on April 1 issued 1,000 more shares. During the period\\nJanuary 1 to March 31, the company had the original 600 shares outstanding. Once the new shares were\\nissued, the company had the original 600 plus the new 1,000 shares, for a total of 1,600 shares for each of the\\nnext nine months—from April 1 to December 31. To determine the weighted average shares, apply these\\nfractional weights to both of the stock amounts (see Figure 6.6).\\n6.5 • Market Value Ratios 177', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Clear Lake Sporting Goods has generated $3.75 of earnings ($35,000 less the $5,000 of preferred\\ndividends) for each of the 8,000 common shares of stock it has outstanding.\\nMeasuring Performance with Earnings per Share\\nEarnings per share is a key profitability measure that both current and potential common stockholders\\nmonitor. Its importance is accentuated by the fact that GAAP requires public companies to report earnings per\\nshare on the face of a company’s income statement. This is the only ratio that requires such prominent\\nreporting. If fact, public companies are required to report two different earnings per share amounts on their\\nincome statements—basic and diluted. We’ve illustrated the calculation of basic earnings per share. Diluted\\nearnings per share, which is not demonstrated here, involves the consideration of all securities, such as stocks\\nand bonds, that could potentially dilute, or reduce, the basic earnings per share.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nFinding Earning per Share for Public Companies\\nWhere can you find earnings per share information on public companies?

Enter the ticker for the company you are looking up, and a basic\\nchart and graph will display with stock price data along with several commonly used ratios (including\\nearnings per share).\\nAs you review data, keep in mind that a company can manipulate or impact its earnings per share by\\nissuing new shares or buying back issued shares. What are the ethical implications of earnings per share\\ncalculations?\\nCommon stock shares are normally purchased by investors to generate income through dividends or to sell at\\na profit in the future. Investors realize that inadequate earnings per share can result in poor or inconsistent\\ndividend payments and fluctuating stock prices. As such, companies seek to produce earnings per share\\namounts that rise each period. However, an increase in earnings per share may not always reflect favorable\\nperformance, as there are multiple reasons that earnings per share may increase.

Apple continued to have a healthy financial position with\\nample cash supply. It repurchased $18.5 billion of its own stock in the second quarter of 2020.1 The total\\nstock buyback over the preceding five years was $282.87 billion, which is 3.5 times higher than any other\\ncompany. Since the earnings per share calculation is earnings divided by average outstanding shares, the\\nfewer shares there are outstanding, the higher earnings per share goes without the firm having to actually\\nraise earnings.\\nWhat do you think?

The company\\nneeds to use its assets and operations efficiently to increase profit. To assist with profit goal attainment,\\ncompany revenues need to outweigh expenses. Let’s consider three profitability measurements and ratios:\\nprofit margin, return on total assets, and return on equity.\\nProfit Margin\\nProfit margin represents how much of sales revenue has translated into income. This ratio shows how much\\nof each $1 of sales is returned as profit. The larger the ratio figure (the closer it gets to 1), the more of each\\nsales dollar is returned as profit. The portion of the sales dollar not returned as profit goes toward expenses.\\nThe formula for profit margin is\\nFor Clear Lake Sporting Goods, the profit margin in the current year is\\nThis means that for every dollar of sales, $0.29 returns as profit.

This\\nconcept puts forward the idea that a dollar received today is worth more than, and therefore preferable to, a\\ndollar received at some point in the future. The three primary reasons for this are that (1) money received now\\ncan be saved or invested now and earn interest or a return, resulting in more money in the future; (2) any\\npromise of future payments of cash will always carry the risk of default; and (3) it is simple human nature for\\npeople to prefer making their purchases of goods and services in the present rather than waiting to make\\nthem at some future time.\\nFor this reason, it is important to incentivize people to give up their present consumption patterns by offering\\nthem greater value in the future. Based on the concept of TVM, it can be said that a dollar was worth more to\\nus, and thus carried more value, yesterday than it is to us today. It also then follows that a dollar in our\\npossession right now carries a greater value for us than a dollar we might receive tomorrow or at some other\\npoint in the future.\\nThe entire concept of the time value of money is particularly important because it allows savers and investors\\nto make better-informed decisions about what to do with their money. TVM can help a person understand\\nwhich option may be best based on the critical factors of overall risk, rates of interest, inflation, and return.\\nTVM can also be used to help a person understand how much money they’ll need to save in an interest-\\nbearing account in order to reach a desired financial goal, such as saving $50,000 in 10 years in an account that\\nearns 4% compound interest each year.

However, we know that this is not always the\\ncase. Sometimes it is simply a better idea to save your money. While inflation can have the effect of making a\\ndollar worth less tomorrow than it is worth today, the positive effect of compound interest works in favor of\\nsavers and investors.\\n7.1 Now versus Later Concepts\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain why time has an impact on the value of money.\\n• Explain the concepts of future value and present value.\\n• Explain why lump sum cash flow is the basis for all other cash flows.\\nHow and Why the Passage of Time Affects the Value of Money\\nThe concept of the time value of money (TVM) is predicated on the fact that it is possible to earn interest\\nincome on cash that you decide to deposit in an investment or interest-bearing account. As times goes by,\\ninterest is earned on amounts you have invested (present value), which effectively means that time will add\\nvalue (future value) to your savings. The longer the period of time you have your money invested, the more\\ninterest income will accrue. Also, the higher the rate of interest your account or investment is earning, again,\\nthe more your money will grow.\\nUnderstanding how to calculate values of money in the present and at different points in the future is a key\\ncomponent of understanding the material presented in this chapter—and of making important personal\\nfinancial decisions in your future (see Figure 7.2).\\nFigure 7.2 The Time Value of Money It is better to be paid today, or you will lose out on the money you would have earned in\\ninterest.\\nThe Lump Sum Payment or Receipt\\nThe most basic type of financial transaction involves a simple, one-time amount of cash, which can be either a\\nreceipt (inflow) or a payment (outflow). Such a one-time transaction is typically referred to as a lump sum. A\\nlump sum consists of a one-off cash flow that occurs at any single point in time, present or future. Because it is\\nalways possible to dissect more complex transactions into smaller parts, the lump sum cash flow is the basis\\non which all other types of cash flow are treated. According to the general principle of adding value, every type\\nof cash flow stream can be divided into a series of lump sums. For this reason, it is critical to understand the\\nmath associated with lump sums if you wish to have a greater appreciation, and a complete understanding, of\\nmore complicated forms of cash flow that may be associated with an investment or a capital purchase by a\\n192 7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

This concept is referred to as future\\nvalue (FV). In short, future value refers to how a specific amount of money today can have greater value\\ntomorrow.\\nSingle-Period Scenario\\nLet us start with the following example. Your friend is considering putting money in a bank account that will\\npay 4% interest per year and is particularly interested in knowing how much money they will have one year\\nfrom now if they deposit $1,000 in this account. Your friend understands that you are studying finance and\\nturns to you for help. By using the TVM principle of future value (FV), you can tell your friend that the answer is\\n$1,040. The additional $40 that will be in the account after one year will be due to interest earned over that\\ntime. You can calculate this amount relatively easily by taking the original deposit (also referred to as the\\nprincipal) of $1,000 and multiplying it by the annual interest rate of 4% for one period (in this case, one year).\\nBy taking the interest earned amount of $40 and adding it to the original principal of $1,000, you will arrive at a\\ntotal value of $1,040 in the bank account at the end of the year. So, the $1,040 one year from today is equal to\\n$1,000 today when working with a 4% earning rate. Therefore, based on the concept of TVM, we can say that\\n$1,040 represents the future value of $1,000 one year from today and at a 4% rate of interest. We will discuss\\ninterest rates and their importance in TVM decisions in more detail later in this chapter; for now, we can\\nconsider interest rate as a percentage of the principal amount that is earned by the original lender of funds\\nand/or charged to the borrower of these same funds. Following are a few more examples of the single-period\\nscenario.\\nIf a person deposits $300 in an account that pays 5% per year, at the end of one year, they will have\\nIf a company has earnings of $2.50 per share and experiences a 10% increase in the following year, the\\nearnings per share in year two are\\nIf a retail store decides on a 3% price increase for the following year on an item that is currently selling for $50,\\nthe new price in the following year will be\\nThe Impact of Compounding\\nWhat would happen if your friend were willing to wait one more year to receive their lump sum payment?\\nWhat would the future dollar value in their account be after a two-year period? Returning to our earlier\\nexample, assume that during the second year, your friend leaves the principal ($1,000) and the earned interest\\n($40) in the account, thereby reinvesting the entire account balance for another year. The quoted interest rate\\nof 4% reflects the interest the account would earn each year, not over the entire two-year savings period. So,\\nduring the second year of savings, the $1,000 deposit and the $40 interest earned during the first year would\\n7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics 193', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Unfortunately, you\\nare not in a position to buy it right away and will have to wait at least another six years before you can\\nafford it. If house values are appreciating at an annual rate of inflation of 4%, how much will a similar house\\ncost after six years?\\nSolution:\\nIn this case, PV is the current cost of the house, or $400,000; n is six years; r is the average annual inflation\\nrate, or 4%; and we have to solve for FV.\\nTherefore, under these circumstances, the house will cost $506,127.60 after six years.\\nHow Time Impacts Compounding\\nWe have just seen that time will lead to the growth of our money. As long as the prevailing growth or interest\\nrate of any account we have our money in is positive, the passage of time will have the effect of growing the\\nvalue of our money. The longer the period of time, the greater the growth and the larger the future value of\\nthe money will be. This can be reinforced very clearly with the following example.\\nMelvin is saving money in an account at a local bank that earns 5% per year. He begins with a deposit in his\\naccount of $100 and decides to save his money for exactly one year. He will not be making any further deposits\\ninto the account during the year. Melvin will earn or $5, in interest income. Adding this to the\\noriginal deposit balance of $100 will give him a total of or $105, in the account at the end of one\\nyear.\\nMelvin likes this idea and believes he may be able to keep his money in the account for a longer period of time.\\nHow much money will he have in his account, without any further deposits, at the end of years two, three, four,\\nand five?\\n7.2 • Time Value of Money (TVM) Basics 195', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

His friend suggests finding an\\naccount or some form of investment with a greater interest rate than the 5% he can get at his local bank.\\nMelvin thinks he can leave his money in an account or investment for a total of five years. He found\\ninvestments that will provide annual returns of 6%, 7%, 10%, and 12%. Using the\\nformula, we can complete the following calculations for him:\\nAgain, Melvin likes this information, and he states that he will try to find the highest interest rate available. This\\nmakes sense, but it’s important to remember that investments are usually not guaranteed to earn you specific\\ninterest rates, or rates of return. Most investments, other than Treasury investments such as Treasury bonds,\\ncarry some form of financial risk, either small or large, and the greater the rate of return, the more likely it is\\nthat the risk associated with the investment will also be greater. This risk does not have any effect on the\\nfuture calculations we have just completed, but it an important factor to bear in mind and consider well before\\nmoving ahead and putting your money in any investment or financial instrument.\\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain how future dollar amounts are calculated.\\n• Explain how present dollar amounts are calculated.\\n• Describe how discount rates are calculated.\\n• Describe how growth rates are calculated.\\n• Illustrate how periods of time for specified growth are calculated.\\n• Use a financial calculator and Excel to solve TVM problems.\\nWe can determine future value by using any of four methods: (1) mathematical equations, (2) calculators with\\nfinancial functions, (3) spreadsheets, and (4) FVIF tables. With the advent and wide acceptance and use of\\nfinancial calculators and spreadsheet software, FVIF (and other such time value of money tables and factors)\\nhave become obsolete, and we will not discuss them in this text. Nevertheless, they are often still published in\\nother finance textbooks and are also available on the internet to use if you so choose.\\nUsing Timelines to Organize TVM Information\\nA useful tool for conceptualizing present value and future value problems is a timeline.

Now we will move on to the different\\nmethods available that will help you solve specific TVM problems. These are the financial calculator and the\\nExcel spreadsheet.\\nUsing a Financial Calculator to Solve TVM Problems\\nAn extremely popular method of solving TVM problems is through the use of a financial calculator. Financial\\ncalculators such as the Texas Instruments BAII Plus™ Professional (https://openstax.org/r/baii-plus-\\nprofessional) will typically have five keys that represent the critical variables used in most common TVM\\nproblems: NN, I/YI/Y, PVPV, FVFV, and PMTPMT. These represent the following:\\nThese are the only keys on a financial calculator that are necessary to solve TVM problems involving a single\\npayment or lump sum.\\nExample 1: Future Value of a Single Payment or Lump Sum\\nLet’s start with a simple example that will provide you with most of the skills needed to perform TVM functions\\ninvolving a single lump sum payment with a financial calculator.\\n7.3 • Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems 197', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

You will naturally be interested in knowing how much money you will have in your account at the\\nend of this four-year time period (assuming you make no other deposits and withdraw no cash).\\nTo answer this question, you will need to work with factors of $1,000, the present value (PVPV); four periods or\\nyears, represented by NN; and the 3% interest rate, or I/YI/Y. Make sure that the calculator register information is\\ncleared, or you may end up with numbers from previous uses that will interfere with the solution. The register-\\nclearing process will depend on what type of calculator you are using, but for the TI BA II Plus™ Professional\\ncalculator, clearing can be accomplished by pressing the keys 2ND2NDand FVFV[CLR TVM].\\nOnce you have cleared any old data, you can enter the values in the appropriate key areas: 4 for NN, 3 for I/YI/Y,\\nand 1000 for PVPV. Now you have entered enough information to calculate the future value. Continue by\\npressing the CPTCPT(compute) key, followed by the FVFVkey.

This is because most financial calculators\\n(and spreadsheets) follow something called the cash flow sign convention, which is a way for calculators and\\nspreadsheets to keep the relative direction of the cash flow straight. Positive numbers are used to represent\\ncash inflows, and negative numbers should always be used for cash outflows.\\nIn this example, the $1,000 is an investment that requires a cash outflow. For this reason, -1000 is entered as\\nthe present value, as you will be essentially handing this $1,000 to a bank or to someone else to initiate the\\ntransaction. Conversely, the future value represents a cash inflow in four years’ time. This is why the calculator\\ngenerates a positive 1,125.51 as the end result of this calculation.\\nHad you entered the present value of $1,000 as a positive number, there would have been no real concern, but\\nthe ending future value answer would have been returned expressed as a negative number. This would be\\ncorrect had you borrowed $1,000 today (cash inflow) and agreed to repay $1,125.51 (cash outflow) four years\\nfrom now. Also, it is important that you do not change the sign of any input value by using the --(minus) key).\\nFor example, on the TI BA II Plus™ Professional, you must use the +|-+|-key instead of the minus key. If you\\nenter 1000 and then hit the +|-+|-key, you will get a negative 1,000 amount showing in the calculator display.\\nAn important feature of most financial calculators is that it is possible to change any of the variables in a\\nproblem without needing to reenter all of the other data. For example, suppose that we wanted to find out the\\nfuture value in our bank account if we left the money from our previous example invested for 20 years instead\\n1 The specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II Plus™ Professional model, but you can use other\\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\\n198 7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

When a user\\nbegins to type a function into a spreadsheet, Excel provides helpful information in the form of on-screen tips\\nshowing the argument inputs that are required to complete the function. In our spreadsheet example, as the\\nFV formula is being typed into cell E2, a banner showing the arguments necessary to complete the function\\nappears directly below, hovering over cell E3.\\nFigure 7.3 Using the FV Function in Excel\\nCells E1 and E2 show how the FV function appears in the spreadsheet as it is typed in with the required\\narguments. Cell E4 shows the calculated answer for cell E1 after hitting the enter key. Once the enter key is\\npressed, the hint banner hovering over cell E3 will disappear. The second example of the FV function in our\\nexample spreadsheet is in cell E6. Here, the actual numerical values are used in the FV function equation\\nrather than cell references. The method in cell E8 is referred to as hard coding. In general, it is preferable to\\nuse the cell reference method, as this allows for copying formulas and provides the user with increased\\nflexibility in accounting for changes to input data.

By reversing this process, we can safely state that $127.63 received five years from now with a 5%\\ninterest (or discount) rate would have a value of just $100 today. Thus, $100 is its present value. In Excel, the\\nPV function is used to determine present value (see Figure 7.7).\\nFigure 7.7 Using the PV Function in Excel\\nThe formula in cell E1 uses cell references in a similar fashion to our FV example spreadsheet above. Also\\nsimilar to our earlier example is the hard-coded formula for this calculation, which is shown in cell E6. In both\\ncases, the answers we arrive at using the PV function are identical, but once again, using cell references is\\npreferred over hard coding if possible.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nDetermining Present Value When Other Variables Are Known\\nYou have just won a second-prize lottery jackpot that will pay a single total lump sum of $50,000 five years\\nfrom now.

How much will you need to put away today at 5% interest to have $20,000 a year from now?\\nEssentially, you are trying to determine how much $20,000 one year from now is worth today at 5% interest\\nover the year. To find a present value, we reverse the growth concept and lower or discount the future value\\nback to the current period.\\nThe interest rate that we use to determine the present value of a future cash flow is referred to as the\\ndiscount rate because it is bringing the money back in time in terms of its value. The discount rate refers to\\nthe annual rate of reduction on a future value and is the inverse of the growth rate. Once we know this\\ndiscount rate, we can solve for the present value (PV), the value today of tomorrow’s cash flow. By changing\\nthe FV equation, we can turn\\ninto\\nwhich is the present value equation. The fraction shown above is referred to as the present value interest\\nfactor (PVIF). The PVIF is simply the reciprocal of the FVIF, which makes sense because these factors are doing\\nexactly opposite things. Therefore, the amount you need to deposit today to earn $20,000 in one year\\nat 5% interest is\\nThe Multiple-Period Scenario\\nThere will often be situations when you need to determine the present value of a cash flow that is scheduled to\\noccur several years in the future (see Figure 7.17).

The TVM concept and its specific applications are frequently used\\nby individuals and organizations that might wish to better understand the values of financial assets and to\\nimprove investing and saving strategies, whether these are personal or within business environments.\\nAs we have discussed, the key element behind the concept of TVM is that a given amount of money is worth\\nmore today than that same amount of money will be at any point in the future. Again, this is because money\\ncan be saved or invested in interest-bearing accounts or investments that will generate interest income over\\ntime, thus resulting in increased savings and dollar values as time passes.\\nInflation\\nThe entire concept of TVM exists largely due to the presence of inflation. Inflation is defined as a general\\nincrease in the prices of goods and services and/or a drop in the value of money and its purchasing power.\\nThe purchasing power of the consumer dollar is a statistic tracked by the part of the US Bureau of Labor\\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance 215', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

One of the important ideas relating to the concept of TVM is that it\\nis preferable to spend money today instead of at some point in the future (all other things being equal) when\\ninflation is positive. However, in very rare instances in our economy when inflation is negative, spending\\nmoney later is preferable to spending it now. This is because in cases of negative inflation, the purchasing\\npower of a dollar is actually greater in the future, as the costs of goods and services are declining as we move\\ninto the future.\\nMost investors would be inclined to take a payment of money today rather than wait five years to receive a\\npayment in the same amount. This is because inflation is almost always positive, which means that general\\nprices of goods and services tend to increase over the passage of time. This is a direct function and result of\\nnormal economic growth. The crux of the concept of TVM is directly related to maintaining the present value\\nof financial assets or increasing the value of these financial assets at different points in the future when they\\nmay be needed to obtain goods and services. If a consumer’s monetary assets grow at a greater rate than\\ninflation over any period of time, then the consumer will realize an increase in their overall purchasing power.\\nConversely, if inflation exceeds savings or investment growth, then the consumer will lose purchasing power\\nas time goes by under such conditions.\\nThe Impact of Inflation on TVM\\nThe difference between present and future values of money can be easily seen when considered under the\\neffects of inflation. As we discussed above, inflation is defined as a state of continuously rising prices for goods\\nand services within an economy. In the study of economics, the laws of supply and demand state that\\nincreasing the amount of money within an economy without increasing the amount of goods and services\\navailable will give consumers and businesses more money to spend on those goods and services. When more\\nmoney is created and made available to the consuming public, the value of each unit of currency will diminish.\\n216 7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Another concept in economics states that this relationship between\\nmoney supply and monetary value is one of the primary reasons why the Federal Reserve might at times\\ntake steps to inject money into a stagnant, lethargic economy. Increasing the money supply will lead to\\nincreased economic activity and consumer spending, but it can also have the negative effect of increasing the\\ncosts of goods and services, furthering an increase in the rate of inflation.\\nConsumers who decide to save their money now and for the foreseeable future, as opposed to spending it\\nnow, are simply making the economic choice to have their cash on hand and available. So, this ends up being a\\ndecision that is made despite the risk of potential inflation and perhaps losing purchasing power. When\\ninflationary risk is low, most people will save their money to have it available to spend later. Conversely, in\\ntimes when inflationary risk is high, people are more likely to spend their money now, before its purchasing\\npower erodes. This idea of inflationary risk is the primary reason why savers and investors who decide to save\\nnow in order to have their money available at some point in the future will insist they are paid, through\\ninterest or return on investment, for the future value of any savings or financial instrument.\\nLower interest rates will usually lead to higher inflation. This is because, in a way, interest rates can be viewed\\nas the cost of money. This allows for the idea that interest rates can be further viewed as a tax on holding on\\nto sums of money instead of using it. If an economy is experiencing lower interest rates, this will make money\\nless expensive to hold, thus incentivizing consumers to spend their money more frequently on the goods and\\nservices they may require. We have also seen that the more quickly inflation rates rise, the more quickly the\\ngeneral purchasing power of money will be eroded. Rational investors who set money aside for the future will\\ndemand higher interest rates to compensate them for such periods of inflation. However, investors who save\\nfor future consumption but leave their money uninvested or underinvested in low-interest-bearing accounts\\nwill essentially lose value from their financial assets because each of their future dollars will be worth less,\\ncarrying less purchasing power when they end up needing it for use. This relationship of saving and planning\\nfor the future is one of the most important reasons to understand the concept of the time value of money.\\nNominal versus Real Interest Rates\\nOne of the main problems of allowing inflation to determine interest rates is that current interest rates are\\nactually nominal interest rates. Nominal rates are “stated,” not adjusted for the effects of inflation. In order to\\ndetermine more practical real interest rates, the original nominal rate must be adjusted using an inflation\\nrate, such as those that are calculated and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics within the consumer\\nprice index (CPI).\\nA concept referred to as the Fisher effect, named for economist Irving Fisher, describes the relationship\\nbetween inflation and the nominal and real interest rates and is expressed using the following formula:\\nwhere i is the nominal interest rate, R is the real interest rate, and h is the expected inflation rate.\\nAn example of the Fisher effect would be seen in the case of a bond investor who is expecting a real interest\\nrate of return of 6% on the bond, in an economy that is experiencing an expected inflation rate of 2%. Using\\nthe above formula, we have\\nSo, the nominal interest rate on the bond amounts to 8.12%, with a real interest rate of 6% within an economy\\nthat is experiencing a 2% inflation rate. This is a logical result because in a scenario of positive inflation, a real\\nrate of return would always be expected to amount to less than the stated or nominal rate.\\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance 217', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It is\\ntherefore extremely important that we understand how TVM and government fiscal policy can affect our\\nsavings, investments, purchasing behavior, and our overall personal financial health.\\nCompounding Interest\\nAs we discussed earlier, compound interest can be defined as interest that is being earned on interest. In\\ncases of compounding interest, the amount of money that is being accrued on previous amounts of earned\\ninterest income will continue to grow with each compounding period. So, for example, if you have $1,000 in a\\nsavings account and it is earning interest at a 10% annual rate and is compounded every year for a period of\\nfive years, the compounding will allow for growth after one year to an amount of $1,100. This comprises the\\noriginal principal of $1,000 plus $100 in interest. In year two, you would actually be earning interest on the\\ntotal amount from the previous compounding period—the $1,100 amount.\\nSo, to continue with this example, by the end of year two, you would have earned $1,210 ($1,100 plus $110 in\\ninterest). If you continue on until the end of year five, that $1,000 will have grown to approximately $1,610.\\nNow, if we consider that the highest annual inflation rate over the last 20 years has been 3%, then in this\\nscenario, choosing to invest your present money in an account where interest is being compounded leaves\\nyou in a much better position than you would be in if you did not invest your money at all. The concept of the\\ntime value of money puts this entire idea into context for us, leading to more informed decisions on personal\\nsaving and investing.\\nIt is important to understand that interest does not always compound annually, as assumed in the examples\\nwe have already covered. In some cases, interest can be compounded quarterly, monthly, daily, or even\\ncontinuously. The general rule to apply is that the more frequent the compounding period, the greater the\\nfuture value of a savings amount, a bond, or any other financial instrument. This is, of course, assuming that\\nall other variables are constant.\\nThe math for this remains the same, but it is important that you be careful with your treatment and usage of\\nrate (r) and number of periods (n) in your calculations.\\nFor example, $1,000 invested at 6% for a year compounded annually would be worth\\n. But that same $1,000 invested for that same period of time—one year—and\\nearning interest at the same annual rate but compounded monthly would grow to\\n, because the interest paid each month is earning interest on interest at a 6%\\nrate. Note that we represent r as the interest paid per period and n as the number\\nof periods (12 months in a year; ) rather than the number of years, which is only one.\\nContinuing with our example, that same $1,000 in an account with interest compounded quarterly, or four\\ntimes a year, would grow to in one year. Note that this final amount ends up\\nbeing greater than the annually compounded future value of $1,060.00 and slightly less than the monthly\\n218 7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The formula for the rule of 72 is expressed as the unknown (the required amount of time\\nto double a value) calculated by taking the number 72 and dividing it by the known interest rate or growth\\nrate. When using this formula, it is important to note that the rate should be expressed as a whole integer, not\\nas a percentage.

A good\\nnonfinancial use of the rule of 72 might be to apply it to some population projections. For example, an increase\\nin a country’s population growth rate from 2% to 3% could present a serious problem for the planning of\\nfacilities and infrastructure in that country. Instead of needing to double overall economic capacity in or\\n36, years, capacity would have to be expanded in only , or 24, years. It is easy to see how dramatic an\\neffect this would be when we consider that the entire schedule for growth or infrastructure would be reduced\\nby 12 years due to a simple and relatively small 1% increase in population growth.\\nInvesting and Risk\\nInvesting is usually a sound financial strategy if you have the money to do so. When investing, however, there\\nare certain risks you should always consider first when applying the concepts of the time value of money. For\\nexample, making the decision to take $1,000 and invest it in your favorite company, even if it is expected to\\nprovide a 5% return each year, is not a guarantee that you will earn that return—or any return at all, for that\\nmatter. Instead, as with any investment, you will be accepting the risk of losing some or even all of your money\\nin exchange for the opportunity to beat inflation and increase your future overall wealth. Essentially, it is risk\\nand return that are responsible for the entire idea of the time value of money.\\nRisk and return are the factors that will cause a rational person to believe that a dollar risked should end up\\nearning more than that single dollar.\\nTo summarize, the concept of the time value of money and the related TVM formulas are extremely important\\nbecause they can be used in different circumstances to help investors and savers understand the value of their\\nmoney today relative to its earning potential in the future. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that\\ninflation has on your money and why saving your money early can help increase the value of your savings\\ndollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects of inflation.\\n220 7 • Time Value of Money I: Single Payment Value\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

For example, let’s consider the\\ndecision to go to college after you graduate from high school. This decision, as with just about any other, will\\ninvolve evaluating opportunity costs. If you choose to go to college, this will result in your sacrificing four years\\nof potential earnings that you could have had if you had decided to take a job instead of attending school.\\nAlso, in addition to the lost salary, you would be losing out on four years of work experience that could have\\nhad a positive impact on your résumé or your future earnings prospects.\\nOf course, the entire idea behind furthering one’s education is that you are hopeful that by choosing to go to\\ncollege, you will increase the likelihood of earning a greater salary over the course of your lifetime than you\\nwould have if you had chosen to join the workforce directly out of high school. So, this ends up being a bit of a\\nrisk, but one that you have considered. The idea is that you are hoping for a more significant payoff down the\\nroad than if you had made the decision not to continue with your studies. When it comes to opportunity costs\\nand the time value of money, it is obvious that there will always be costs associated with every forgone\\nfinancial opportunity we pass on when we make a different choice. The logical individual can only hope that\\nthese choices produce a better end result than if we had made different choices and pursued any of our\\nforgone alternatives. This also applies in situations where we may sit idly by and decide to take no action at all.\\nFor example, if you are putting $1,000 in a savings account to save for a house, you may be giving up an\\nopportunity to grow that money in an investment account that would earn a greater rate of return. In another\\nexample, being able to calculate the future value of your money will tell you that instead of investing, you\\nprobably should be paying down your 24% APR credit card debt that is costing you hundreds of dollars a\\nmonth—hundreds of dollars more than you might earn from an investment account.\\n7.4 • Applications of TVM in Finance 221', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The single-period scenario is one way in which future amounts are calculated.\\nCompounding, which is interest earned on interest, also affects the future value of money.\\n7.3 Methods for Solving Time Value of Money Problems\\nCalculations can be used to determine future and present dollar amounts, discount and growth rates, and\\nperiods of time required for specific growth. Time value of money problems can be solved using mathematical\\nequations, calculators with financial functions, and spreadsheets. A useful tool for conceptualizing present\\nvalue and future value problems is a timeline. A timeline is a visual, linear representation of the timing of\\nperiods and cash flows over a set amount of time.\\n7.4 Applications of TVM in Finance\\nThe idea of the time value of money is often considered to be the cornerstone concept of the study of finance.\\nTVM can help investors and savers understand the value of money today relative to its earning potential in the\\nfuture. TVM is critical to understanding the effect that inflation has on money and why saving your money\\nearly can help increase the value of your savings dollars by giving them time to grow and outpace the effects\\nof inflation. Of course, it is important to remember that there will always be possible options that are sacrificed\\nwith every option you decide on and every choice you make.\\nKey Terms\\nBureau of Labor Statistics a group within the United States Department of Labor that is the primary fact-\\nfinding agency for the US government in the fields of labor, statistics, and economics; serves as the\\nprincipal agency of the US Federal Statistical System\\ncompounding interest the continual addition of interest to the original principal sum of a loan or deposit,\\noften referred to as interest on interest\\ncompounding period the period between points in time when interest is paid or added to the principal\\nconsumer price index (CPI) a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of\\nconsumer goods and services such as transportation, food, and medical care\\ndiscount rate the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash inflows\\nFederal Reserve the central bank system of the United States\\nfinancial instrument an asset or bundle of assets, including monetary contracts between parties, that can\\nbe bought, sold, or traded for financial gain\\nfinancial risk the possibility of losing money or purchasing power on an investment, business transaction, or\\nventure or simply due to inflation\\nFisher effect an economic theory created by economist Irving Fisher that describes the relationship between\\ninflation and both real and nominal interest rates\\nfuture value (FV) the value that a current amount will grow to at a given interest rate over a given period of\\ntime\\ngross domestic product (GDP) the total value of goods produced and services provided in a country during\\none year\\n222 7 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

An old adage in finance claims, “If you aren’t in control of\\nyour money, your money is controlling you.” Fortunately, learning to manage your money is not difficult if\\nyou’re disciplined and understand some simple techniques. For example, several years ago, the author was\\nnegotiating for a three-year auto loan from a well-known regional dealer, who was offering an interest rate of\\n2%. When the manager left the room for a few minutes, we pulled out a financial calculator and proved in less\\nthan a minute that the actual interest rate in the payments he was proposing was nearly double the quoted\\nand advertised rate.\\nIn addition to understanding how the loan process works, which improves your negotiation skills when\\nborrowing, businesses and individuals can better control their investments by understanding basic rules of\\nfinance, particularly as seen in this and the preceding chapter. Assume you pledge to invest $1,000 per year at\\n5% return per year and are curious about how much you will have accumulated by age 60. If you begin at age\\n30, you will have $69,760; if you begin at age 20, you will have $126,840. Can the extra 10 years make that much\\nof a difference? We’ll see that indeed they can, and the calculations required to prove it can take less than two\\nminutes.\\nAs another example, many professionals confuse income and wealth during their career growth.

Decision-\\nmakers consider how investments, projects, and even opportunity costs gain value as we move forward into\\nthe future. They similarly consider how value in the future can be reduced to a value in present or past\\nperiods. We saw that these value projections are called determination of future value (compounding, moving\\nforward on a timeline) or present value (discounting, moving backward on a timeline). The easiest way to\\nvisualize this movement through time, whether forward or backward, is by use of a timeline.\\nThroughout the first chapter on the time value of money, we were analyzing a single amount. In this chapter,\\nwe deal with a stream of payments made periodically—in other words, payments made or received regularly\\nover a span of time. We begin with the illustration of a perpetuity.\\nWhat Is a Perpetuity?\\nA perpetuity is a series of payments or receipts that continues forever, or perpetually. One of the best ways to\\nanalyze the basics of an annuity (the stream of payments to be paid or received in the future) is by starting\\nwith a perpetuity. The most common examples of perpetuities in the author’s experience are college chair\\nendowments and preferred stock.\\nIf you gift $1,500,000 to a college to name a professor’s chair for your family, you might specify that the money\\nmust be held in perpetuity and invested by the college to yield a fixed 3%. The college will take those proceeds\\nof the investment, leaving your original $1,500,000 intact, and use the annual interest of $45,000 to fund a\\nportion of the professor’s salary.\\nAnother common example is preferred stock. Most preferred stock issues carry a fixed and predetermined\\nrate of dividend. If we assume that the dividend will not change in future years, then preferred dividend\\nshareholders will receive a fixed amount of money in future years—assuming, of course, that the company’s\\nboard of directors declares the dividends sufficient to fund these requirements. If we assume that the dividend\\nis declared and paid and that it remains constant, this represents a perpetuity.\\nFor example, Shaw Inc. has issued 100,000 shares of preferred stock with a stated value of $50 and a 4%\\ndividend. Therefore, if they can fund and decide to declare dividends for the full amount, they will pay out\\n$200,000, or $2.00 per preferred share. Because shares such as these are created with the intention of\\ncontinuity, the owner of this preferred stock can theoretically expect this dividend income stream in\\nperpetuity.\\nTo place a current market value on this stream of future income, how much should an investor pay for one\\nshare of this preferred stock? The calculation is a present value. The amount the investor pays today for that\\none share is equal to the annual dividend (assuming it is declared and paid) divided by the rate of return. But\\nbe careful—it is not the rate on the face of the preferred stock but the required rate of return, the “market\\nrate” that investors expect from a stock of this level of risk. We must also note an important fact affecting all\\n228 8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Determining the present value, however, is possible, although one might wonder how. As we learned\\nearlier, the greater the amount of time used in a present value calculation, the smaller the amount of dollars\\nneeded at the beginning, regardless of the interest rate involved. Therefore, when we discount each payment\\nin an infinite series, remembering that we would then add them together once we discount them to the\\npresent, the infinite payments become negligible at some point and will no longer have a significant impact on\\ntoday’s value. To grow to one dollar 70 years from now, even at a growth rate of 5% per year, we would only\\nneed $0.0329—not even four cents. Keeping all other facts the same, if we had 100 years to grow an\\ninvestment to one dollar, we would only need 0.76 cents—not even a whole penny! There is no question that\\nthe effect of time is substantial and dramatic.\\nThe study of perpetuities in corporate finance is a first step to understanding valuation models of certain\\ninvestments, such as the dividend discount model and the constant growth model, to be addressed in other\\nchapters. Our ability to discount future cash flows, even infinite cash flows, to a present value is a clue to the\\nprice at which a company’s stock might trade. From a personal financial planning perspective, the individual\\ninvestor is also better able to be certain that they are paying a fair price for holdings in their portfolio. For\\npurposes of long-term or retirement planning, the investor must consider that a fixed and unchanging\\ndividend, such as from preferred stock, might not adequately protect the holder from inflation in times of\\nrising prices.\\nHow to Value a Perpetuity\\nGiven these facts, how do we place a value on a perpetuity? Let’s keep the preferred stock example for Shaw\\nInc. in mind. The holder of one share will expect to receive a $2.00 dividend for every share owned. Although a\\nperpetuity may allow for growth of that dividend, we will hold that constant now. We must know one\\nadditional fact: the required rate of return. This is our random variable, which can cause fluctuation in the\\nprice of the preferred stock. Let’s assume that the required rate of return, which we’ll call RS, is 7%. This is the\\nrate of return that the market expects in order to take on the risk of an investment such as Shaw.\\nDetermination of the price of Shaw’s preferred stock becomes quite simple because the expected annual cash\\nflow should not change, making it a constant perpetuity. The constant perpetuity formula is\\nwhere PV is the price of the preferred stock, C is the constant dividend, and Rs is the required rate of return.\\nBy substitution,\\nThe price one should pay for a share of Shaw’s preferred stock is $28.57.\\nHere’s another constant perpetuity to try. The preferred stock of Rooney Corporation pays an annual dividend\\nof $1.75 per share. If the required rate of return in the market for shares such as Rooney’s is 5.8%, at what\\nprice should these preferred shares be trading? The answer is , or $30.17.\\nSome investments might involve a growing perpetuity. In this case, some degree of change in the amount of\\nthe dividend is expected. The formula is altered slightly to include a rate of growth in the denominator, noted\\nas G, making the growing perpetuity formula\\n8.1 • Perpetuities 229', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Present or future values\\nof these streams of payments can be calculated by applying time value of money formulas to each of these\\npayments. We’ll begin with determining the present value.\\nBefore exploring present value, it’s helpful to analyze the behavior of a stream of payments over time. Assume\\nthat we commit to a program of investing $1,000 at the end of each year for five years, earning 7%\\ncompounded annually throughout. The high rate is locked in based partly on our commitment beginning\\ntoday, even though we will invest no money until the end of the first year. Refer to the timeline shown in Table\\n8.1.\\nYear 0 1 2 3 4 5\\nBalance Forward ($) 0.00 0.00 1,000.00 2,070.00 3,214.90 4,439.94\\nInterest Earned ($) 0.00 70.00 144.90 225.04 310.80\\nPrincipal Added ($) 1,000.00 1,000.00 1,000.00 1,000.00 1,000.00\\nNew Balance ($) 1,000.00 2,070.00 3,214.90 4,439.94 5,750.74\\nTable 8.1\\nAt the end of the first year, we deposit the first $1,000 in our fund. Therefore, it has not yet had an opportunity\\nto earn us any interest. The “new balance” number beneath is the cumulative amount in our fund, which then\\ncarries to the top of the column for the next year. In year 2, that first amount will earn 7% interest, and at the\\nend of year 2, we add our second $1,000. Our cumulative balance is therefore $2,070, which then carries up to\\nthe top of year 3 and becomes the basis of the interest calculation for that year. At the end of the fifth year,\\nour investing arrangement ends, and we’ve accumulated $5,750.74, of which $5,000 represents the money we\\ninvested and the other $750.74 represents accrued interest on both our invested funds and the accumulated\\ninterest from past periods.\\nNotice two important aspects that might appear counterintuitive: (1) we’ve “wasted” the first year because we\\ndeposited no funds at the beginning of this plan, and our first $1,000 begins working for us only at the\\nbeginning of the second year; and (2) our fifth and final investment earns no interest because it’s deposited at\\nthe end of the last year. We will address these two issues from a practical application point of view shortly.\\nKeeping this illustration in mind, we will first focus on finding the present value of an annuity. Assume that you\\nwish to receive $25,000 each year from an existing fund for five years, beginning one year from now. This\\nstream of annual $25,000 payments represents an annuity. Because the first payment will be received one year\\nfrom now, we specifically call this an ordinary annuity. We will look at an alternative to ordinary annuities\\nlater. How much money do we need in our fund today to accomplish this stream of payments if our remaining\\nbalance will always be earning 8% annually? Although we’ll gradually deplete the fund as we withdraw\\nperiodic payments of the same amount, whatever funds remain in the account will always be earning interest.\\n8.2 • Annuities 231', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Rather than the multiple steps above, we will use the following\\nequation:\\nwhere PVa is the present value of the annuity and PYMT is the amount of one payment.\\nIn this example, PYMT is $25,000 at the end of each of five years.

Let’s assume you win the North Dakota Lottery for\\n$1.2 million, and they offer you $120,000 per year for 10 years, beginning one year from today. We will ignore\\ntaxes and other nonmathematical considerations throughout these discussions and problems. The Lottery\\nCommission will likely contact you with an alternative: would you like to accept that stream of payments … or\\nwould you like to accept a lump sum of $787,000 right now instead? Can you complete a money-based\\nanalysis of these alternatives? Based purely on the dollars, no, you cannot. The reason is that you can’t\\ncompare future amounts to present amounts without considering the effect of time—that is, the time value of\\nmoney. Therefore, we need an interest rate that we can use as a discounting factor to place these alternatives\\non the same playing field by expressing them in terms of today’s dollars, the present value. Let’s use 9%. If we\\ndiscount the future stream of fixed payments (an ordinary annuity, as the payments are identical and they\\nbegin one year from now), we can then compare that result to the cash lump sum that the Lottery Commission\\nis offering you instead.\\nBy substitution, and following the proper order of operations:\\nAll things being equal, that expected future stream of ten $120,000 payments is worth approximately $770,119\\ntoday.

A variation is the annuity due. The difference between the two is one\\nperiod. That’s all—just one additional period of interest. An ordinary annuity assumes that there is a one-\\nperiod lag between the start of a stream of payments and the actual first payment. In contrast, an annuity due\\nassumes that payments begin immediately, as in the lottery example above. We would assume that you would\\nreceive the first annual lottery check of $120,000 immediately, not a year from now. In summary, whether\\ncalculating future value (covered in the next section) or present value of an annuity due, the one-year lag is\\neliminated, and we begin immediately.\\nSince the difference is simply one additional period of time, we can adjust for this easily by taking the formula\\nfor an ordinary annuity and multiplying by one additional period. One more period, of course, is (1 + i). Recall\\nfrom Time Value of Money I that the formula for compounding is (1 + i)N, where i is the interest rate and N is\\nthe number of periods. The superscript N does not apply because it represents 1, for one additional period,\\nand the power of 1 can be ignored. Therefore, faced with an annuity due problem, we solve as if it were an\\nordinary annuity, but we multiply by (1 + i) one more time.\\nIn our original example from this section, we wished to withdraw $25,000 each year for five years from a fund\\nthat we would establish now. We determined how much that fund should be worth today if we intend to\\nreceive our first payment one year from now. Throughout this fund’s life, it will earn 8% annually. This time,\\nlet’s assume we’ll withdraw our first payment immediately, at point zero, making this an annuity due. Because\\nwe’re trying to determine how much our starting balance should be, it makes sense that we must begin with a\\nlarger number. Why? Because we’re pulling our first payment out immediately, so less money will remain to\\nstart compounding to the amount we need to fund all five of our planned payments! Our rule can be stated as\\nfollows:\\nWhether one is calculating present value or future value, the result of an annuity due must always be larger\\nthan that of an ordinary annuity, all other facts remaining constant. Here is the stream of solutions for the\\nexample above, but please notice that we will multiply by (1 + i), one additional period, following the same\\norder of operations:\\nThat’s how much we must start our fund with today, before we earn any interest or draw out any money. Note\\nthat it’s larger than the $99,817.81 that would be required for an ordinary annuity. It must be, because we’re\\nabout to diminish our compounding power with an immediate withdrawal, so we have to begin with a larger\\namount.\\nWe notice several things:\\n1. The formula must change because the annual payment is subtracted first, prior to the calculation of\\nannual interest.\\n2. We accomplish the same result, aside from an insignificant rounding difference: the fund is depleted once\\nthe last payment is withdrawn.\\n3. The last payment is withdrawn on the first day of the final year, not the last. Therefore, no interest is\\nearned during the fifth and final year.\\n234 8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

When the result is expressed as a\\npercent, it must be the same as the rate of interest used in the annuity calculations. Using our example of an\\nannuity with five payments of $25,000 at 8%, we compare the present values of the ordinary annuity of\\n$99,817.81 and the annuity due of $107,803.24.\\nThe result shows that the present value of the annuity due is 8% higher than the present value of the ordinary\\nannuity.\\nCalculating the Future Value of an Annuity\\nIn the previous section, we addressed discounting a periodic stream of payments from the future to the\\npresent. We are also interested in how to project the future value of a series of payments. In this case, an\\ninvestment may be made periodically. Keeping with the definition of an annuity, if the amount of periodic\\ninvestment is always the same, we may take a one-step shortcut to calculate the future value of that stream by\\nusing the formula presented below:\\nwhere FVa is the future value of the annuity, PYMT is a one-time payment or receipt in the series, r is the\\ninterest rate, and n is the number of periods.\\nAs we did in our section on present values of annuities, we will begin with an ordinary annuity and then\\nproceed to an annuity due.\\nLet’s assume that you lock in a contract for an investment opportunity at 4% per year, but you cannot make\\nthe first investment until one year from now. This is counterintuitive for an investor, perhaps, but because it is\\nthe basis of the formula and procedures for ordinary annuities, we will accept this assumption. You plan to\\ninvest $3,000 at the end of each year. How much money will you have at the end of five years?\\nLet’s start by placing this on a timeline like the one appearing earlier in this chapter (see Table 8.3):\\nYear 0 1 2 3 4 5\\nBalance Forward ($) 0.00 0.00 3,000.00 6,120.00 9,364.80 12,739.39\\nInterest Earned ($) 0.00 120.00 244.80 374.59 509.58\\nPrincipal Added ($) 3,000.00 3,000.00 3,000.00 3,000.00 3,000.00\\nNew Balance ($) 3,000.00 6,120.00 9,364.80 12,739.39 16,248.97\\nTable 8.3\\n236 8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Also, our fifth payment is not made until the last day of our\\ncontract in year 5, so it has no chance to earn a compounded future value. The investor has lost on both ends.\\nIn the table above, we have made five calculations, and for a longer-term contract such as 10, 25, or 40 years,\\nthis would be tedious.

In this way, we don’t waste the first year, and all five payments work in year 5 as well. As\\nstated previously, this means that annuities due will yield larger results than ordinary annuities, whether one is\\ndiscounting (PVa) or compounding (FVa).\\nLet’s hold all facts constant with the previous example, except that we will invest at the beginning of each year,\\nstarting immediately upon locking in this five-year contract.

Whether one is solving for a future value or a present value, the result of an annuity due must\\nalways be larger than an ordinary annuity.

A person might receive a lump-sum\\nwindfall from an investment, and rather than choosing to accept the proceeds, they might decide to invest the\\nsum (ignoring taxes) in an annuity. Their intention is to let this invested sum produce annual distributions to\\nsupplement Social Security payments. Assume the recipient just received $75,000, again ignoring tax effects.\\nThey have the chance to invest in an annuity that will provide a distribution at the end of each of the next five\\nyears, and that annuity contract provides interest at 3% annually. Their first receipt will be one year from now.\\nThis is an ordinary annuity.\\nWe can also solve for the payment given the other variables, an important aspect of financial analysis. If the\\nperson with the $75,000 windfall wants this fund to last five years and they can earn 3%, then how much can\\nthey withdraw from this fund each year? To solve this question, we can apply the present value of an annuity\\nformula. This time, the payment (PYMT) is the unknown, and we know that the PVa, or the present value that\\nthey have at this moment, is $75,000:\\n238 8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Bankers often refer to these lending structures as facilities, and they can be\\ntailored to the specific needs of the borrower in a number of ways. Similarly, lenders develop loans and lines of\\ncredit for individuals. Whether for a business or an individual, the purpose of the loan, method of repayment,\\ninterest rate, specific terms, and time involved must all be tailored to the goals of the borrower and the lender.\\nIn this chapter, we will focus on fixed-rate loans, although other alternatives exist.\\nTypical business loans include the following:\\n• Term loans generally bear a maturity date and a set rate of interest and are typically used to finance\\ninvestments in assets such as equipment, buildings, and possibly other acquired firms. The length of the\\nterm loan is generally designed to match the useful life of the asset being financed, and it will usually be\\nrepaid on a monthly schedule. It’s common for a term loan to be backed by collateral, such as the asset\\nitself or other assets of the business.\\n• Revolving lines of credit (revolvers), are used to finance the short-term working capital needs of a\\nbusiness. Revolvers will have a specific maximum but no set schedule of monthly payments. Interest\\naccrues on the amount of cash that a company has drawn down from the facility. These credit lines may\\nbe secured by accounts receivable, inventory, other assets of the business, or sometimes simply the good\\n8.3 • Loan Amortization 239', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

These are available on the basis of personal credit scores, with data\\nbeing supplied by the three best-known credit reporting firms: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.\\nIndividuals should check their scores with each of these companies at least once per year, which they can\\ndo for no charge. Additional requests from the same company require a small fee.\\n• An unsecured personal loan is an installment loan, initially drawn for a fixed amount and repaid on a\\nperiodic schedule with interest, as we have seen in our annuity examples. Unsecured means that the loan\\nis not secured by collateral but is instead based on the strong credit history of the borrower.\\n• In contrast, a secured personal loan has an asset backing up the unpaid amount, and if the consumer\\ndefaults on the debt, the asset can be seized by the lender to satisfy their claim. A common example is an\\nauto loan, which is secured by the car being purchased; nonpayment or default on the loan can lead to the\\nborrower’s car being repossessed.\\n• A mortgage loan is another type of secured personal loan, but for a longer period, such as 20, 25, or even\\n30 years. The home being purchased or built is the collateral, and the home may be foreclosed upon if the\\nborrower defaults. Full title to the home typically remains with the lender as long as an unpaid balance\\nremains on the debt.\\n• Student loans are borrowings intended to fund college or career education, and they can come from a\\nfinancial institution or the federal government. Interest rates on these loans are generally low and\\nadvantageous, and repayment does not begin until after the borrower’s education is complete (or if they\\ndrop below a certain level of time status, such as becoming a half-time student).\\nCalculating Loan Payments Using Simple Amortization\\nLoan amortization refers to a schedule of how and when a debt will be repaid with interest. As noted, we will\\nfocus on fixed-rate debts, such as auto loans, personal loans with installment payments, or mortgages. Before\\nentering into a borrowing agreement, the borrower can use any of a number of tools to verify the terms being\\noffered, such as the monthly payment on a car loan financed by the dealer. In many cases, this is\\naccomplished by using the present value of an annuity formula:\\nWe’ve already reviewed the present value of ordinary annuities in several examples. Before we look into\\nbusiness or consumer loans and their repayment, we must review an area of Time Value of Money I.\\nWe’re not likely to make annual payments on a home mortgage or auto loan, as these are commonly paid on a\\nmonthly basis. Fortunately, our formulas are easily adjusted from annual to non-annual periods. You will recall\\nthat we solve for non-annual periods in the same way, with two adjustments: (1) we divide the annual interest\\nrate by the number of periods in the year, and (2) we multiply the time periods by the number of those periods\\nwithin a year. Therefore, in the case of monthly debt service, including interest and principal, we use 12\\nperiods.\\nGiven a three-year car loan at 6%, rather than using 6% and 3 periods in our formula, we would instead use\\n0.5% (6% ÷ 12) and 36 periods (3 years × 12), and then apply the present value of an annuity formula in the\\nsame way. Let’s say the three-year, 6% auto loan is for $32,000. You need to know if you can squeeze the\\nmonthly payment into your budget. For our examples, we will ignore any other charges, fees, taxes, or extras\\nthat your lender might include in these payments, and we will focus only on interest and principal repayment.\\n240 8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The length of the loan, coupled with the frequent compounding,\\nemphasizes this. In month 10, the interest and principal amounts “pass” each other, and now the loan balance\\nis dropping at a quicker rate. Finally, note that you will pay more than $56,000 to finance this $140,000\\nborrowing. If you pay off this mortgage over 240 months as planned, the interest cost represents an additional\\n28% of the full cost of the home!\\nIf the borrower has the means to make an accelerated payment against this debt—for example, due to a\\nbonus or other windfall—doing so can make a significant difference in the total cost of financing over the life\\nof the loan. Assume that after three years (month 36), you receive a bonus of $2,000 and decide to apply the\\nentire amount to prepay the remaining balance. Your loan agreement allows you to apply the entire amount to\\nthe remaining unpaid balance of the mortgage. While this might seem equal to just 2.5 months’ worth of\\npayment, the debt is fully paid off almost 6 months ahead of schedule, and total interest is reduced from over\\n$56,000 to $55,000. The ability to prepay long-term debts such as this is clearly worth negotiating initially.\\n8.4 Stated versus Effective Rates\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Explain the difference between stated and effective rates.\\n• Calculate the true cost of borrowing.\\nThe Difference between Stated and Effective Rates\\nIf you look at the bottom of your monthly credit card statement, you could see language such as “The interest\\nrate on unpaid balances is 1.5% per month.” You might think to yourself, “So, that’s 12 months times 1.5%, or\\n18% per year.” This is a fine example of the difference between stated and effective annual interest rates. The\\neffective interest rate reflects compounding within a one-year period, an important distinction because we\\ntend to focus on annual interest rates. Because compounding occurs more than once per year, the true annual\\nrate is higher than appears. Please remember that if interest is calculated and compounded annually, the\\nstated and effective interest rates will be the same. Keep in mind that the following principles work whether\\nyou are the debtor paying off an obligation or an investor hoping for more frequent compounding. The\\ndynamics of the time value of money apply in either direction.\\nEffective Rates and Period of Compounding\\nLet’s remain with our example of a credit card statement that indicates an interest rate of 1.5% per month on\\n8.4 • Stated versus Effective Rates 243', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The practice of offering such loans can be controversial because it can lead to\\nvery high rates of interest, perhaps even illegally high, in an act known as usury. Although some states have\\noutlawed PALs and others place limits on them, some do not. A PAL is a short-term loan in anticipation of a\\nperson’s next paycheck. A person in need of money for short-term needs will write a check on Thursday but\\ndate the check next Thursday, which is their normal payday; assume this transaction is for $200. The lender,\\ntypically operating from a storefront, will advance the $200 cash and hold the postdated check. The lender\\ncharges a fee—let’s say $14—as their compensation. The following Thursday, the borrower is expected to pay\\noff the advance, and if they do not, the lender can deposit the postdated check. If that check has insufficient\\nfunds, more fees and penalties will likely be assessed.\\nOne primary reason that arrangements such as these are controversial is the excessively high nominal (stated)\\ninterest rate that they can represent. For a one-week loan of $200, the borrower is paying $14, or 7% of the\\nborrowed amount. If this is annualized, with 52 seven-day periods in a year, the stated rate is 364%! While a\\nPAL might seem to be an effective immediate solution to a cash shortfall, the mathematics behind the true\\ncost of borrowing simply do not make sense, and a person who uses such arrangements regularly is placing\\nthemselves at a dreadful financial disadvantage.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nHow Tempting Is That Refund Anticipation?\\nRefund anticipation loans (RALs) began in 1987, and they are still available (though not from banks) and\\nused by millions of people.1 Now, RALs come from private lending chains. These loans allow you to\\ndetermine your April 15 personal income tax liability through a preparer and receive an advance against\\nyour expected refund.2 But beware: your ability to analyze the true cost of money is always critical. Like all\\nloans, RALs bear a rate of interest. Let’s assume that the firm that prepared your tax return determines that\\nyou’re entitled to an $800 refund. Once they advance that amount to you, it will bear interest at a certain\\nrate; we’ll assume 0.5% per week. You might expect a tax refund in four weeks. Half a percent of $800\\ndoesn’t sound like much, but what happens when you annualize it into an effective rate, assuming your tax\\nrefund arrives exactly four weeks from when you accept the loan? Assume no compounding during those\\nfour weeks.\\nSolution:\\nA weekly rate of 0.5% on the $800 advance is $4 per week, so for four full weeks, you’ve paid $16 for the use\\nof $800. Of course, that totals 2% of the amount advanced. There are 13 four-week periods in a year, so\\neven though the interest rate appears to be small, it amounts to 26% when annualized! We assumed no\\ncompounding to keep the illustration simple, but we further assume that you are not using this advance\\nthroughout the year. If you were, then periodic compounding would drive the effective rate even higher, to\\njust over 29.3%.\\n1 Michelle Singletary. “Another Reason Not to Opt for a Tax Refund Loan: It May Delay Your Next Stimulus Payment.” Washington\\nPost, February 16, 2021. https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/16/tax-refund-loan-problems/\\n2 Amelia Josephson. “What Is a Refund Anticipation Loan?” SmartAsset.

You will draw $25,000 at the end of\\neach year for five years from a fund earning 8% annually, and you want to know how much you need in that\\nfund today to accomplish this. We accomplish this in Excel easily with the PV function. The format of the PV\\ncommand is\\n=PV(rate,periods,payment,0,0)\\nOnly the first three arguments inside the parentheses are used. We’ll place them in cells and refer to those\\ncells in our PV function. As an option, you could also type the numbers into the parentheses directly. Notice\\nthe slight rounding error because of decimal expansion. Also, the payment must be entered as a negative\\nnumber for your result to be positive; this can be accomplished either by making the $25,000 in cell B5 a\\nnegative amount or by placing a minus sign in front of the B5 in the formula’s arguments. In cell B3, you must\\nenter the percent either as 0.08 or as 8% (with the percent sign). We repeated the formula syntax and the\\nactual formula inputs in column A near the result, for your reference (see Figure 8.3).\\nFigure 8.3 Excel Spreadsheet Showing the Present Value of an Ordinary Annuity\\nWe also found the present value of an annuity due. We use the same information from the ordinary annuity\\nproblem above, but you will recall that the first of five payments happens immediately at the start of year 1,\\nnot at the end. We follow the same procedures and inputs as in the previous example, but with one change to\\nthe PV function: the last argument in the parentheses will change from 0 to 1. This is a toggle switch that\\ncommands the PV function to treat this as an annuity due instead of an ordinary annuity (see Figure 8.4).\\n250 8 • Time Value of Money II: Equal Multiple Payments\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Preferred stock is a common example with a preestablished\\ndividend formula. An indefinite stream of payments cannot be compounded into a future value, but it can be\\ndiscounted to a present value, providing an opportunity to determine the amount an investor should be\\nwilling to pay for a share of that stock.\\n8.2 Annuities\\nAn annuity is a stream of fixed periodic payments that is expected to be paid or received. Calculations of future\\nvalue or present value are commonly performed on these payment streams for a wide number of reasons in\\nbusiness and personal financial analysis, as seen in the chapter focusing on single amounts, particularly in\\nloan repayment. Annuities may be ordinary annuities, in which the first cash flow of a series occurs at the end\\nof the first period, or annuities due, if the first cash flow occurs at the beginning point of the first period.\\n8.3 Loan Amortization\\nLoans are contracts between a lender and a borrower. Failure to observe the rules of that contract, such as\\npayment of interest or repayment of the amount owed, can subject the borrower to substantial penalties as\\nwell as damage to their credit. Loan agreements bearing a fixed rate of interest have a scheduled\\namortization, or rate and time of repayments with interest. Several types of business and personal loans were\\ndescribed.\\n8.4 Stated versus Effective Rates\\nFor a borrower to understand the true cost of financing, they must be familiar with interannual compounding,\\nwhich can cause a stated interest rate that appears to be annual to actually be higher. The effective rate of\\ninterest was demonstrated to understand that true cost.\\n8.5 Equal Payments with a Financial Calculator and Excel\\nThe use of two tools for managing and understanding the time value of money and its many applications was\\ndiscussed: a professional financial calculator and the popular Microsoft Office Suite spreadsheet application\\nExcel.\\nKey Terms\\nannuity a stream of regular, periodic payments to be received or paid\\nannuity due a stream of periodic payments in which the payment or receipt occurs at the beginning of each\\nperiod\\nconstant perpetuity a stream of periodic payments that is expected to continue indefinitely with no change\\nin the amount paid or received\\ndiscount rate an interest rate used in time value of money calculations to determine present value; may\\nderive from several sources, such as stated contract rates, costs to borrow, or expected rates of return on\\ninvestments\\neffective interest rate the interest rate that results when compounding occurs multiple times within a year;\\nthe true cost of borrowing\\ngrowing perpetuity a stream of periodic payments that is expected to continue indefinitely with growth of\\nthe amount paid or received in the future, usually by a fixed percentage\\nloan amortization the scheduling of periodic repayment of a debt, typically involving regular payments or\\nreceipts of amounts that include both interest payment and repayment of the principal of the amount owed\\nlump sum a single cash payment made in lieu of a series of future payments, such as a lottery payout or a\\n8 • Summary 257', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If a stream of payments occurs in\\nwhich the amount of the payments changes at any point, the techniques for solving for annuities must be\\nmodified. Shortcuts that we have seen in earlier chapters cannot be taken. Fortunately, with tools such as\\nfinancial or online calculators and Microsoft Excel, the method can be quite simple.\\nThe ability to analyze and understand cash flow is essential. From a personal point of view, assume that you\\nhave an opportunity to invest $2,000 every year, beginning next year, to save for a down payment on the\\npurchase of your first home seven years from now. In the third year, you also inherit $10,000 and put it all\\ntoward this goal. In the fifth year, you receive a large bonus of $3,000 and also dedicate this to your ongoing\\ninvestment.\\nThe stream of regular payments has been interrupted—which is, of course, good news for you. However, it\\ndoes add a new complexity to the math involved in finding values related to time, whether compounding into\\nthe future or discounting to the present value. Analysts refer to such a series of payments as a mixed stream.\\nIf you make the first payment on the first day of next year and continue to do so on the first day of each\\nfollowing year, and if your investment will always be earning 7% interest, how much cash will you have\\naccumulated—principal plus earned interest—at the end of the seven years?\\nThis is a future value question, but because the stream of payments is mixed, we cannot use annuity formulas\\nor approaches and the shortcuts they provide. As noted in previous chapters, when solving a problem\\ninvolving the time value of money, a timeline and/or table is helpful. The cash flows described above are\\nshown in Table 9.1 . Remember that all money is assumed to be deposited in your investment at the beginning\\nof each year. The cumulative cash flows do not yet consider interest.\\nYear 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\\nCash Invested $0.00 $2,000 $2,000 $2,000 $12,000 $2,000 $5,000 $2,000\\nCumulative Cash Flows $2,000 $4,000 $6,000 $18,000 $20,000 $25,000 $27,000\\nTable 9.1\\nBy the end of seven years, you have invested $27,000 of your own money before we consider interest:\\n• Seven years times $2,000 each year, or $14,000\\n• The extra $10,000 you received in year 3 (which is invested at the start of year 4)\\n• The extra $3,000 you received in year 5 (which is invested at the start of year 6)\\nThese funds were invested at different times, and time and interest rate will work for you on all accumulated\\nbalances as you proceed.

How much of your cash\\nwindfall should you set aside today to accomplish this?\\nLet us break down the problem, remembering that we are thinking in reverse from the earlier problems that\\ninvolved future values. In this case, we’re bringing future values back in time to find their present values.

The importance and understanding of cash flow analysis is fundamental to this text,\\nand several of her insights are highly relevant to our content and procedures here.\\nAA: Ms. Simmons, why is cash management so important to an existing or start-up firm, and how does it\\ncompare to the more basic and traditional focus on profitability?\\nSimmons: While profitability is very useful for analysis by investors to measure performance, an\\norganization’s cash flow provides superior measurement. Cash flow is easy to understand, provides a\\ntransparent way of assessing a firm’s health, and is not subject to any qualifications. By focusing upon cash\\nflow, any firm—whether it is mature or a start-up organization—can have a clear picture of its health and\\nsuccess.\\n270 9 • Time Value of Money III: Unequal Multiple Payment Values\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Can you elaborate on this and why liquidity\\nmanagement is so important to a firm?\\nSimmons: Just as effective forecasting can provide superior cash management, the same holds true for\\nliquidity management. For example, if you are able to confidently predict levels and timing of cash, then\\nbased on that forecast, you can make effective short- and long-term borrowing decisions. A disciplined\\napproach to projecting one’s cash position means that instead of investing cash in the money market to\\nmaximize day-to-day liquidity, you can look into longer-term investments that can provide a significantly\\nhigher return. This is essential to the effective matching of cash inflows and outflows for the firm.\\nAA: In summary, do you have any words of advice to students who might have an eye to entrepreneurial\\nventures?\\nSimmons: “Cash is king,” don’t forget that. Understand how cash moves through a business. It is also very\\nimportant to implement and retain a cash management discipline. Never put that off until later. Many\\ntimes, start-ups will say, “Well, I have all this venture money, and we can start making things happen and\\nworry about being good cash managers later.” But what I’ve seen is that the longer companies wait, the\\nharder it is to break bad habits. Making cash management a priority now will serve entrepreneurs in perfect\\nstead as their business starts to gain traction.\\nWe closed this excellent interview with agreement that we were “kindred spirits” regarding the importance\\nof cash flow analysis, including capital decisions such as those mentioned in this chapter.

Bonds issues are used to raise funds and can be issued by corporations, governments, or even\\nsubagencies of governments (including local municipalities).\\nAs with any type of loan, the borrowing party is expected to offer something to the lender in exchange for\\ntheir time and trouble. In this case, the bond-issuing entity will agree not only to repay the original face value\\nof the loan on a specific date (the maturity of the bond) but also to pay the lender interest—or, in bond\\nterminology, coupon payments.\\nCoupon payments are designed to make a bond purchase more acceptable for investors by helping\\ncompensate them for the time value of money. Because investors are parting with money that they have right\\nnow in order to make the initial bond purchase but will not see repayment of principal until the maturity date\\nof the bond, they will experience the negative impact of time value over the bond term. When a bond issuer\\noffers periodic coupon payments, this helps offset the negative effect of the delayed receipt of the principal\\namount for the investor. Also, because coupon payments will be coming to the investor throughout the term\\nof the bond, essentially in installment payments (an annuity), the time value of money plays a critical role in\\nbond transactions and in calculating bond valuation.\\nBonds, along with stocks and mutual funds, are considered to be one of the most basic financial instruments\\navailable to any investor. It is quite common for investors to round out their portfolios by purchasing bonds,\\nBonds and Bond Valuation\\n10\\n10 • Why It Matters 283', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Thus, future cash flows from the bond are clearly stated per agreement and fixed when the bond\\nsale is completed.\\nBonds are a basic form of investment that typically include a straightforward financial agreement between\\nissuer and purchaser. Nevertheless, the terminology surrounding bonds is unique and rather extensive. Much\\nof the specialized vocabulary surrounding bonds is designed to convey the concept that a bond is similar to\\nother financial instruments in that it is an investment that can be bought and sold. Much of this unique\\nterminology will be covered later in this chapter, but we can set out some of the basics here with an example.\\nLet’s say that you buy a $1,000 bond that was issued by Apple Inc. at 5% interest, paid annually, for 20 years.\\nHere, you are the lender, and Apple Inc. is the borrower.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nInformational Basics on Bonds\\nThis video (https://openstax.org/r/the-basics-of-bonds) from MoneyWeek editor Tim Bennett provides\\ninformation about the basics of bonds—what they are, how they work, why companies and governments\\nissue them, and why investors might buy them.\\nBasic Terminology\\nWe need to know the following basic bond terms and pricing in order to apply the necessary time value of\\nmoney equation to value this Apple, Inc. bond issue:\\n• Par value: A bond will always clearly state its par value, also called face amount or face value. This is equal\\nto the principal amount that the issuer will repay at the end of the bond term or maturity date. In our\\nexample, the par value of the bond is $1,000.\\n• Coupon rate: This is the interest rate that is used to calculate periodic interest, or coupon payments, on\\nthe bond. It is important to note that coupon rates are always expressed in annual terms, even if coupon\\npayments are scheduled for different periods of time. The most common periods for coupon payments\\nother than annual are semiannual and quarterly. Coupon rates will typically remain unchanged for the\\nentire life of the bond. In our example, the coupon rate is the 5% interest rate.\\n• Coupon payment: This refers to the regular interest payment on the bond. The coupon or periodic\\ninterest payment is determined by multiplying the par value of the bond by the coupon rate. It is\\nimportant to note that no adjustment needs to be made to the coupon rate if the bond pays interest\\n284 10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In our example, the maturity date is at the end\\nof the 20-year period.\\n• Yield to maturity (YTM): The YTM is essentially the discount rate used to bring the future cash flows of a\\nbond into present value terms.

These investments are considered safe\\nbecause they have the full backing of the US government and the likelihood of default (nonpayment) is\\nremote. However, T-bills also pay the least interest due to their safety and the economics of risk and return,\\nwhich state that investors must be compensated for the assumption of risk. As risk increases, so should return\\non investment. Treasury notes are a form of government security that have maturities ranging from one to 10\\nyears, while Treasury bonds are long-term investments that have maturities of 10 to 30 years from their date\\nof issue.\\nSavings bonds are debt securities that investors purchase to pay for certain government programs.\\nEssentially, the purchase of a US savings bond involves the buyer loaning money to the government with a\\nguaranteed promise that they will earn back the face value of the bond plus a certain amount of interest in the\\nfuture. Savings bonds are backed by the US government, meaning that there is virtually no possibility of the\\nbuyer losing their investment. For this reason, the return on savings bonds is relatively low compared to other\\nforms of bonds and investments.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nGovernment Bonds\\nReview this introductory video (https://openstax.org/r/treasury-bonds-prices) about government bonds.\\nMunicipal bonds (“munis”) are issued by cities, states, and localities or their agencies. Munis typically will\\nreturn a little more than Treasury bills while being just a bit riskier.\\nCorporate Bonds\\nCorporate bonds are issued by companies. They carry more risk than government bonds because corporations\\ncan’t raise taxes to pay for their bond issues. The risk and return of a corporate bond will depend on how\\ncreditworthy the company is. The highest-paying and highest-risk corporate bonds are often referred to as\\nnon-investment grade or, more commonly, junk bonds.\\nCorporate bonds that do not make regular coupon payments to their owners are referred to as zero-coupon\\nbonds. These bonds are issued at a deep discount from their par values and will repay the full par value at\\ntheir maturity date. The difference between what the investor spends on them in original purchase price and\\nthe par value paid at maturity will represent the investor’s total dollar value return.\\nConvertible bonds are similar to other types of corporate bonds but have a feature that allows for their\\nconversion into a predetermined number of common stock shares. The conversion from the bond to stock can\\nbe done at certain times during the bond’s life, usually at the discretion of the bondholder.\\n286 10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Though the global fixed-income debt\\nmarket remains considerably larger than the global stock market, this is not an entirely fair comparison. Bond\\nmarkets include sovereign bonds, or bonds that are issues by governments, while stock markets do not. Some\\nexperts believe that a more relevant comparison is between the value of corporate bond markets only\\n(excluding sovereign bonds) and total stock market value.\\nThe chart in Figure 10.2 provides global market value information by category so that we may make our own\\nconclusions about these markets.\\nFigure 10.2 Global Bonds versus Stocks: Total Market Values ($Trillions), November 2020 (data source: Nasdaq)\\nWhile the total value of bond markets continues to exceed that of stocks, the prevailing trend over the past\\nseveral years has been that stock markets are gaining in terms of total market size. The primary reason for this\\nis that stocks have traditionally outperformed bonds in terms of return on investment over extended periods\\nof time and are likely to continue to do so. This makes them more attractive to investors, despite the higher\\nrisk associated with stock.\\nThe Two Sides of a Bond Investment\\nThere are essentially two sides to a bond investment, meaning the bondholder will receive two types of cash\\ninflow from the bond investment over its term. These are the payment of the par value at maturity (often\\nreferred to as payment of the face value of the bond at term end), and the periodic coupon payments (also\\ncalled interest income) from the bond. These coupon payments are contractually determined and clearly\\nindicated in the bond issue documentation received by the bondholder upon purchase.\\nAs a result of these two types of inflow, bond valuation requires two different time value of money\\ntechniques—specifically, present value calculations—to be computed separately and then added together.\\nThe Relationship between Bond Prices and Interest Rates\\nBond price and interest rate have an inverse relationship. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise, and vice\\nversa (see Figure 10.3). If interest rates increase, the value of bonds sold at lower interest rates will decline.\\nSimilarly, if interest rates decline, the value of fixed-rate bonds will increase.

Common benchmark rates include the US Treasury note rate, the Federal Reserve funds rate\\n(federal funds rate), the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), and the prime rate.\\nSo, investors who decide to purchase normal (fixed rate) bonds may not be thrilled to hear that the economy is\\nsignaling inflation and that interest rates are forecasted to rise.

What is its value\\nto these interested parties? Remember that a bond is a financial asset that a company sells to raise money\\nfrom willing investors. Whether you are the company selling the bond or the investor buying the bond, you\\nwant to make sure that you are selling or buying at the best available price.\\nLet’s begin our pricing examples with the 3M Company corporate bond listed in Table 10.1 above.

While\\nthis is not specified in the table, let’s say these are 15-year corporate bonds. In that case, we know that they\\nwere issued on September 20, 2011.\\nThe 3M bonds have an annual coupon rate of 2.25%, which indicates that the annual interest payment on the\\nbond will be the face value (assumed to be $1,000.00 multiplied by 2.25%), or $22.50. The appropriate discount\\nrate to apply to these future payments is the yield to bond maturity, 1.24%.\\nNote that the 3M bond is selling at a premium (above par or face value) due to the fact that its coupon rate is\\ngreater than the YTM percentage. This means that the bond earns more value in interest than it loses due to\\ndiscounting its cash flows to allow for the time value of money principle.\\nFinally, the table tells us some of the bond’s features. For example, Standard & Poor’s, an international rating\\nagency, rates 3M Co. as A+ (high credit quality). Additionally, the bonds are designated as callable, meaning\\nthat 3M has the option of redeeming them before their maturity on September 19, 2026.\\nWe can price a bond using the same methods from earlier chapters: an equation, a calculator, and a\\nspreadsheet. Let’s start with the equation method (see Figure 10.4).\\nFigure 10.4 Steps in Pricing a Bond\\nThe first step is to identify the amounts and the timing of the two types of future cash flows to be received on\\nthe bond. Any bond that pays interest or coupon payments (coupon bonds) will have two sources of future\\ncash flow to its bondholder/investor: the periodic coupon payments, which are a form of annuity, and the final\\nlump sum payment of the face value amount at maturity.\\nAs discussed above, the principal or face value is paid in a one-time lump sum payment at bond maturity. In\\nour example with 3M Co., this is the $1,000 par value of the bond that will be paid on the maturity date of\\nSeptember 19, 2026. Step 1 is to lay out the timing and amount of the future cash flows. The first future cash\\nflow we need to determine is the annual interest payment. Here, it is the coupon rate of 2.25% times the par\\nvalue of the bond. As mentioned above, we will use $1,000 as the par value of this bond, so the annual coupon\\nor interest payment will equal $22.50:\\nThe next future cash flow that we need to determine is the payment of the par value or principal—in this case,\\nthe $1,000 par value of the bond—at the maturity date of September 19, 2026. We can set out the future cash\\nflows for the bond as shown in Table 10.2:\\n10.2 • Bond Valuation 289', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

At this point, we can apply previously learned concepts: the coupon payments\\nconstitute an annuity stream, or payments of the same amount at regular intervals.\\nThe principal of $1,000 is also paid out at maturity. Here, we recognize another key concept: the final amount\\nis a lump sum payment. So, we now have the promised set of future cash flows for the 3M Co. bond.\\nIn Step 2, we will need to decide on a discount rate to use on these future bond cash payments.

This makes logical sense when one considers that an investment in a bond involves\\na series of future cash inflows, or payments from the bond issuer to the bondholder over the term of the\\nbond’s maturity.\\nTo determine the value of a bond today, the two-step time value of money calculation we discussed earlier\\nmust be used, and the present value of a series of coupon payments (or an annuity) must be determined. This\\npresent value amount will then be added to the present value of a single lump sum payment (the principal or\\nface value) that will come to the bondholder at the end of the bond’s term (maturity).\\nFixed Income\\nBecause standard fixed-rate bonds have their coupon payments and maturity amounts locked in, they are\\noften referred to as fixed-income investments. This is because their values are relatively straightforward to\\ncalculate. Bonds are generally viewed as stable investments that offer income and a lower amount of volatility\\ncompared to stocks.\\n1 The specific financial calculator in these examples is the Texas Instruments BA II PlusTM Professional model, but you can use other\\nfinancial calculators for these types of calculations.\\n10.2 • Bond Valuation 291', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The coupon rate is the interest rate printed on the bond; this is only used to determine the\\ninterest or coupon payments. The yield to maturity (YTM) is an interest rate that is used to discount the bond’s\\nfuture cash flow. The YTM is derived from the marketplace and is based on the riskiness of future cash flows.\\nAs we have seen when pricing bonds, a bond’s YTM is the rate of return that the bondholder will receive at the\\ncurrent price if the investor holds the bond to maturity.\\nYield to Maturity\\nAs noted above, the market sets this discount rate, or the yield to maturity. The YTM reflects the going rate in\\nthe bond market for this type of bond and the bond issuer’s perceived ability to make the future payments.\\nHence, we base the yield on a mutually agreeable price between seller and buyer. The bond market\\ndetermines the YTM and the available supply of competing financial assets. By competing against other\\navailable financial assets, the YTM reflects the risk-free rate and inflation, plus such premiums as maturity and\\ndefault specific to the issued bond.\\nThe YTM is the expected return rate on the bond held to maturity. How do we determine the bond’s YTM? We\\ncan use our same three trusty methods: equations, a financial calculator, and Microsoft Excel (as shown at the\\nend of the chapter).\\n2 Adam Hayes. “What Do Constantly Low Bond Yields Mean for the Stock Market?” Investopedia.

Thus, if you know the bond’s current price and\\nall of the future cash flows, you can find the YTM, or the return rate that the bond buyer is receiving on the\\nfunds loaned to the bond issuer. As mentioned, Excel spreadsheets are as easy and accurate as a financial\\ncalculator for determining bond rates, and we will cover these later in the chapter.\\nDetermining Bond Price or Value Using a Calculator\\nLet’s say a friend recommends a 20-year bond that has a face value of $1,000 and a 6% annual coupon rate.

We refer to such a bond as a discount bond.\\n• When the coupon rate and YTM are identical, a bond will sell at its par value. Bonds that experience this\\nscenario in the market are referred to as par value bonds.\\nThe interest or coupon payments of a bond are determined by its coupon rate and are calculated by\\nmultiplying the face value of the bond by this coupon rate.\\nThe inverse relationship of interest rates and bond prices is an important concept for investors to know.\\nBecause interest rates fluctuate and can change significantly over time, it is important to understand how\\nthese changes will impact bond values.\\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Use the yield curve to show the term structure of interest rates.\\n• Describe and define changes in the yield curve shape.\\n• Explain the importance of the yield curve shape.\\n296 10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

This is because they represent interest rates for different periods of time, maturities, or terms.\\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\\nconnected, the resulting line is called a yield curve. Essentially, the yield curve is a result of this plotting\\nprocess and becomes a graphical representation of the term structure of interest rates. A yield curve will\\nalways be constructed by showing the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or time periods on\\nthe x-axis (see Figure 10.5).\\nTo create a useful graph of the yield curve, interest rate yields should be computed for all government bonds\\nat all remaining times to maturity. For example, the yields on all government bonds with a single year\\nremaining until maturity should be calculated. This value is then plotted on the y-axis against the one-year\\nterm on the x-axis. Similarly, yields on government bonds with two years remaining until maturity are\\ncalculated and plotted on the y-axis against two years on the x-axis, and so on, until a point of critical mass of\\ninformation is reached and the resulting graph displays useful information.\\nThe yield curve for government bonds is also known as the risk-free yield curve because these securities are\\nthought of as safe investments that are not expected to fail or default and will in all likelihood repay or\\notherwise meet all financial obligations made through the bond issuance.\\nFigure 10.5 A Normal Yield Curve: Long-Term Rates Are Higher Than Short-Term Rates\\nA normal yield curve slopes upward, with yield increasing as the term increases. This is because yields on\\nfixed-income investments such as bonds will rise as maturity periods increase and produce greater levels of\\nrisk.\\nCorporate issuers of bonds will usually offer bond issues at higher yields that the government, which is\\nunderstandable because they are potentially riskier for investors. Government securities are guaranteed by\\ngovernments and have little to no chance of default or nonpayment. This is not the case for corporate bonds,\\nwhere there is always a chance of default, though the likelihood of this occurring will vary by individual\\ncompany or issuer as well as by bond type and term.

The level\\nof a yield curve directly relates to the yield rates depicted on the y-axis of the graph (see Figure 10.6). The\\nslope of the yield curve indicates the difference between yields on short-term and longer-term investments.\\nThe difference in yields is primarily due to investors’ expectations of the direction of interest rates in the\\neconomy and how the federal funds rate (referred to as cash rate in many countries) is uncertain and may\\ndiffer significantly over time. As an example, yields on three-year bonds incorporate the expectations of\\ninvestors on how bank rates might move over the next three years, combined with the uncertainty of those\\nrates over the three-year period.\\nFigure 10.6 Changes in Yield Curve Depending on Cash Rate\\nAs we briefly discussed above, a positive or normal yield curve is indicative of the investment community’s\\nrequirements for higher rates of return as financial consideration for assuming the risk of entering into fixed-\\nincome investments, such as the purchase of bond issues. Typically, as a bond term increases, so will the\\npotential interest rate risk to the bondholder. Therefore, bonds with longer terms will usually carry higher\\ncoupon rates to make returns greater for investors. Additionally, economists have come to believe that a steep\\npositive yield curve is a sign that investors anticipate relatively high inflation in the future and thus higher\\ninterest rates accompanied by higher investment yields over shorter (inflationary) periods of time.\\nNormal yield curves are generally observed during periods of economic expansion, when growth and inflation\\nare increasing. In any expansionary economy, there is a greater likelihood that future interest rates will be\\nhigher than current rates. This tends to occur because investors will anticipate the Fed or the central bank\\nraising its short-term rates in response to higher inflation rates within the economy.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nHow COVID-19 Impacted the Yield Curve\\nFigure 10.7 shows the relatively normal-shaped yield curve effective in February 2021.\\n298 10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Essentially, the potential actions of the central\\nbank to improve the economy have the effect of lowering overall money rates with the economy, which is\\nexactly what investors anticipated would happen and why the yield curve was inverted to begin with.\\nThe yield curve was considered normal with an upward slope in August 2018, as shown in Figure 10.8, but\\nthe curve inverted in March 2019 as yields on short-term bonds exceeded those of longer-term bonds,\\nresulting in concerns surrounding impending recession and other economic problems. This inverted shape\\nto the yield curve continued into 2020, as evidenced in Figure 10.9.\\nFigure 10.8 The Economy Shifts to an Inverted Yield Curve (data source: US Department of the Treasury, Resource Center,\\nDaily Treasury Yield Curve Rates)\\nYield curves constructed on different days in early 2020 appeared similar to the examples below.

The most common and best-known\\nrisks are interest rate risk and default risk, but other risks exist that should be understood. Among these\\nrisks are the following:\\n• Credit risk. If investors believe that a bond issuer is unlikely to meet its payment commitments, they may\\ndemand a higher yield to purchase the bond issue in the first place. Due to the relative stability of\\ngovernments compared to corporations, government bonds are considered to have low credit risk.\\n• Liquidity risk. If investors believe that a bond may be difficult to sell, it will likely have a higher yield. This\\nhas the effect of compensating the bondholder for the lack of liquidity (the ability to cash out of the bond).\\nGovernment bonds usually have the lowest yields of all investments available and are typically among the\\nmost liquid in any country where they are traded. Government securities will only face significant liquidity\\nrisk in times of great economic distress.\\n• Duration risk. Duration risk is the risk associated with the sensitivity of a bond’s price to a single 1%\\nchange in interest rates. A bond’s duration is expressed in numerical measurements. The higher the\\nduration number, the more sensitive a bond investment will be to changes in interest rates.\\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default 301', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Call risk is the risk of bonds being redeemed or called by the issuing\\nfirm before their maturity dates. Corporations may elect to call a bond issue (provided the bond issue has\\na call feature) when interest rates drop and companies are in a position to save a great deal of money by\\nissuing new bonds with lower coupon rates. To investors, this is a risk in and of itself, but call risk also has\\nthe effect of potentially causing reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk is defined as the risk to investors\\nwhen they find themselves facing unfavorable alternatives for investing the proceeds from their called\\nbonds in new, lower-paying investments. This can potentially lead to substantial financial loss for the\\noriginal bond investors.\\n• Term risk. Investors will generally demand higher returns for lending funds at fixed interest rates. This is\\nbecause doing so exposes them to the risks presented by rising interest rates and the negative impact of\\nthese higher rates on their bond holdings. In a scenario of rising interest rates, investors will find that\\ntheir return from lending money through a bond purchase just once, at a fixed interest rate, will be lower\\nthan the return they might have realized from making several different investments for much shorter\\nperiods of time. Term risk is usually measured by a special indicator referred to as the term premium.\\nAs mentioned above, however, the most common forms of bond risk are interest rate risk and default risk.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nAs we have discussed, when interest rates rise, bond values will fall. This is the general concept behind interest\\nrate risk. Any investor in fixed-income securities (such as bonds) will have to contend with interest rate risk at\\none time or another. Interest rate risk is also referred to as market risk and usually increases the longer an\\ninvestor maintains a bond investment.\\nDefault Risk\\nAny time a bond is purchased, the investor is taking a risk that the bond issuer may be late in making\\nscheduled payments on a bond issue—or, in the worst case, may not be able to make payments at all. This is\\nthe underlying idea behind the concept of default risk.\\nBecause US Treasury securities have the full backing of the government, they are generally considered free of\\ndefault risk. However, most corporate bonds will face some possibility of default. Obviously, some bonds and\\ntheir issuing companies are riskier in this respect than others.\\nTo assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks, bond ratings are regularly published\\nby a number of organizations to express their assessment of the risk quality of various bond issues. We will\\ndiscuss these bond ratings and the companies that issue them next.\\nBond Ratings and Rating Providers\\nIt is important for investors to know the risks they are assuming when investing in bonds. Many investors will\\ntake advantage of information provided by bond rating services to assess the likelihood of borrowers (bond\\nissuers) defaulting on the financial obligations of their bond issues.\\nTo help investors evaluate the default risks of bonds, rating agencies (bond rating services) were\\nestablished to evaluate bonds and other fixed-income investments, taking into consideration and then\\nanalyzing any information that has been published or otherwise made available to the investing public. These\\nservices then apply a rating system that has been developed for measuring the quality of bonds and assign\\nindividual grades to each bond and its issuing company.\\nThe three largest and best-known bond rating providers are Fitch Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, and\\nStandard & Poor’s (S&P) Global Ratings. The rating system used by these services identifies the very highest-\\nquality bonds (the least likely to default) as triple-A (AAA or Aaa), followed next in quality level by double-A\\nbonds (AA or Aa), and so on. Any bond that is rated BBB (S&P, Fitch) / Baa (Moody’s) or higher is referred to as\\ninvestment grade and is considered strong and stable by the investment community (see Table 10.11).\\n302 10 • Bonds and Bond Valuation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The coupon rate of a\\nbond is determined by the issuer and is generally tied to the overall level of interest rates in the economy at\\nthe time of issue as well as the maturity period of the bond and the credit rating of the issuer. The established\\ncoupon rate then governs how much periodic interest is paid to bondholders. For example, if an investor\\npurchases a 5%, $1,000 bond with a 20-year maturity and annual coupon payments, that investor will receive\\n20 coupon payments equal to or for a total of $1,000.\\nDepending on interest and inflation rates over the 20-year period, this could be a very favorable situation\\nresulting in significant realized return for the investor. However, if interest rates and inflation over the\\ninvestment period are at high levels, the investment is not nearly as attractive.\\nGenerating Capital Gains\\nMany bonds are not held until their maturity dates. Should an investor require funds before maturity, they\\nhave the option to sell them through a broker in the secondary market. When this situation occurs, the\\ninvestor may earn a capital gain or experience a capital loss, depending on whether the bond ends up being\\nsold at a premium (above face value) or at a discount (below face value).\\nFor example, if an investor bought a corporate bond yielding 7% and then the economy changed so that\\ncomparable bonds yielded 10%, the investor would have to lower their price on the original 7% bond until it\\nalso yielded the 10% market rate. Potential investors would not be very likely to buy the bond if they could\\nsimply buy a newly issued bond from an alternate issuer and receive a higher coupon rate.\\nIt is equally possible that prevailing bond rates could fall and an investor could end up selling their bond at a\\nhigher price, thus earning a capital gain.\\nBond Laddering as an Investment Strategy\\nThere are several successful strategies for successful bond investments, but perhaps one of the most common\\nyet ingenious of these strategies is called bond laddering. Bond ladders help investors achieve diversity in\\ntheir portfolios and reduce risk while helping maintain regular cash inflows in the form of coupon payments or\\ninterest. In a bond ladder, an investor will divide their total investment dollars among various bonds that\\nmature at regular intervals, thereby balancing risk and return. An example of a bond ladder would be to\\npurchase 10 different bonds that have maturities of one year, two years, three years, and so on, all the way\\nthrough to 10 years.\\nWhen the first bond matures, the investor will purchase a new bond that matures in 10 years to take its place\\nin the ladder and continue the overall laddering strategy.\\nThis strategy has several benefits. First, the shorter-term bonds in the ladder provide stability because they are\\nless sensitive to risk than longer-term bonds. The longer-term bonds within the ladder will generally provide\\nhigher returns but with higher risk due to such factors as rising interest rates. So, by investing in bonds with\\ndifferent maturities and creating a bond ladder, investors can realize superior financial returns to what they\\nwould earn by only investing in short-term bonds. Also, the general level of risk from a bond ladder is reduced\\nby the shorter-term component of the investment mix, making the bond ladder less risky than an investment\\nthat only included long-term bonds.\\nIt is easy to see why bond laddering has become such a highly adopted bond investment strategy with\\ninvestors ranging from novice to the most well-seasoned and experienced.\\nInterest Rate Movements and Bond Prices\\nWe now know that when investors buy bonds, either directly or through mutual funds, they are lending money\\nto bond-issuing firms or governments. In turn, issuers promise to pay back the principal (par or face value)\\nwhen the loan is due at the bond’s maturity date.\\n10.4 • Risks of Interest Rates and Default 305', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

There are three primary categories of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and\\nconvertible bonds. These different types of bond vary depending on their issuer, length until maturity, interest\\nrate, and risk.\\n10.2 Bond Valuation\\nIt is important to ascertain what a given bond is worth to a willing buyer and a willing seller. We can price a\\nbond using an equation, a calculator, or a spreadsheet. The essential steps are (1) identify the amount and\\ntiming of the future cash flow; (2) determine the discount rate; (3) find the present values of the lump sum\\nprincipal and the annuity stream of coupons; and (4) add the present value of the lump sum principal and the\\npresent value of the coupons.\\n10.3 Using the Yield Curve\\nWhen interest rate yields are plotted against their respective maturity periods and these plotted points are\\nconnected, the resulting line is called the yield curve. The yield curve is a graphical representation of the term\\nstructure of interest rates. A yield curve always shows the value of yields (rates) on the y-axis and maturities or\\ntime periods on the x-axis.\\n10.4 Risks of Interest Rates and Default\\nBecause bonds are fixed-income investments, they are subject to a number of risks that could have negative\\neffects on their market value. The most common and best-known risks are interest rate risk and default risk,\\nbut there are some others risks that should be understood, such as credit risk, liquidity risk, duration risk, call\\nrisk, investment risk, and term risk. To assist potential bond investors in understanding some of these risks,\\nbond ratings have been developed and are regularly published by a number of organizations to express their\\nassessment of the risk quality of various bond issues.\\n10.5 Using Spreadsheets to Solve Bond Problems\\nMicrosoft Excel can be used to solve common bond problems. It can be used to calculate the value of a coupon\\nbond, the yield to maturity (interest rate) of a bond, the maturity period of a bond, and the coupon rate and\\ninterest (coupon) payments of a bond.\\nKey Terms\\nbond call a feature of certain bonds or other fixed-income instruments that allows the issuer to repurchase\\nand retire these instruments before maturity\\nbond price the present, discounted value of the future cash stream generated by a bond; the sum of the\\npresent values of all likely coupon payments and the present value of the par value at maturity\\nbond ratings grades assigned to bonds by rating services that indicate their overall credit quality\\nBusiness Cycle Dating Committee a subdivision of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), the\\nUS government agency that maintains a chronology of US business cycles\\ncall risk the risk that a bond issuer will redeem a callable bond prior to maturity\\ncapital gains the increase in a capital asset’s value that is realized when the asset is sold\\ncash rate the interest rate that a central bank, such as the Reserve Bank of Australia or the US Federal\\nReserve System, will charge commercial banks for loans; also known as the bank rate or the base interest\\nrate\\nconvertible bonds fixed-income corporate debt securities that yield interest payments but can be converted\\ninto a predetermined number of common stock or equity shares\\n10 • Summary 313', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

This involves calculating a number of financial ratios that help identify trends,\\nbringing elements of operational performance to light and allowing for clearer analysis and evaluation.\\nA well-proven analytical approach for investors to use in evaluating common stock is to review the overall\\nmarket value of the company that issues a stock. One of the most consistently used calculations in this\\nanalysis, which has important applications in company and common stock evaluation, is the price-to-earnings\\n(P/E) ratio.\\nThe P/E ratio is computed using the following formula:\\n320 11 • Stocks and Stock Valuation\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Essentially, the P/E\\nratio is representative of the price an investor must pay for every unit of current (or future) corporate\\nearnings.\\nBottom-line earnings are a critical factor in valuing common stock. Investors will always want to know how\\nprofitable a company is now as well as how profitable it will be in the future. When a company’s bottom line\\nremains relatively flat over a period of time, leaving earnings per share (EPS) relatively unchanged, the P/E\\nratio can be interpreted as the payback period for the original amount paid for each share of common stock.\\nFor example, the common stock price of Cameo Corp. is currently at $24.00 a share, and its EPS for the year is\\n$4.00. Cameo’s P/E ratio is calculated as\\nThis ratio would typically be expressed in the form . Essentially, this means that investors are willing to pay\\nup to six dollars for every one dollar of earnings. It can also be stated that Cameo stock is currently trading at\\na multiple of six.\\nThe P/E ratio is typically expressed in two primary ways. The first is as a metric listed by most finance websites\\nand often carries the notation P/E (ttm). This refers to the Wall Street acronym for “trailing 12 months” and\\nsignals the company’s operating performance over the past 12 months.\\nAnother form of the P/E ratio is known as the forward (or leading) P/E. This uses future earnings projections\\nrather than actual trailing amounts. The leading P/E, sometimes called the estimated price to earnings, is\\nuseful for comparing current earnings to future earnings and helps provide a clearer picture of what earnings\\nmay look like, assuming there are no major changes in the company’s operations or accounting treatments.\\nReferring back to our calculation for Cameo Corp. above, because the current EPS was used in the calculation,\\nthis ratio would be classified as a trailing P/E ratio. If we had used an estimated or projected EPS as the\\ndenominator in the calculation, it would then be considered a leading P/E ratio.\\nAnalyzing a company’s P/E ratio alone or within a vacuum will actually tell an analyst very little. It is only when\\na company’s P/E is compared to historical P/E ratios or the P/E ratios of other companies in the same industry\\nthat it becomes a useful tool for analysis. One of the most important benefits of using comparative P/E ratios\\nis that they can standardize stocks with different prices and various earnings levels.\\nGenerally speaking, it is very difficult to make any conclusions about a stand-alone stock value, such as\\nwhether a stock that has a ratio of is a good buy at its current price or if a stock with a P/E ratio of is\\ntoo expensive, without performing any relevant comparisons or further analysis.\\nAnalysts have many different ways to interpret P/E ratio data. One of the most common interpretations is that\\nfirms with high P/E ratios should be growth companies. Also, a high P/E ratio could mean that a stock’s price is\\nhigh relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. This could signal a possible undesired downward\\nadjustment in market price in the future.\\nWe can extrapolate from the argument above to put forward the idea that stocks with low P/E ratios should be\\nstabler, more mature organizations. A low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to\\nearnings and that there may be an opportunity to take advantage of upward price movements and potential\\ninvestment gains through stock price appreciation.\\nWhile this information is often very useful for evaluating stocks and making investment decisions, caution\\nmust always be used, as a current stock price may simply be out of line with the company’s earning potential,\\nwhich would mean that price adjustments are likely to occur in the short term. This is why experienced\\nanalysts and investors will use multiple evaluation techniques when conducting stock analysis and evaluation\\nand not rely solely on insights provided by a single set of facts or one form of statistical measurement.\\n11.1 • Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation 321', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It is\\noften the metric of choice for evaluating financial services firms such as real estate firms, insurance\\ncompanies, and investment trusts. The P/B ratio has a notable shortcoming, however, in that it does not\\nevaluate companies that have a high level of intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights.\\nUltimately, this ratio will tell an analyst exactly how much potential investors are willing to pay for each dollar\\nof asset value. The PB(M/B) ratio is computed by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the\\ncompany’s current book value per share, which is calculated by either of the following two equations:\\nNet book value is equal to net assets, or the total assets minus the total liabilities of the company.\\nAnalysts often consider a low P/B ratio (less than 1) to indicate that a stock is undervalued and a higher ratio\\n(greater than 1) to mean that a stock is overvalued. A low ratio may be an indication that something is wrong\\nwith the company or that an investor may be paying too much for any residual value should the company be\\nliquidated.\\nHowever, many market experts will argue the exact opposite of the above interpretations. Because of these\\ndiscrepancies in interpretation and overall variance of opinion, the use of alternate stock valuation metrics,\\neither in addition to or in place of the P/B ratio, is always worth exploring.\\nIn conclusion, the P/B ratio can help a company understand if its net assets are comparable to the market\\nprice of its stock.

These are equity\\nmultiples and enterprise value (EV) multiples. Additionally, there are two primary methods by which to\\nperform analysis using these multiples. These methods are comparable company analysis (comps) and\\nprecedent transaction analysis (precedents).\\nExperienced financial analysts advocate the use of multiples in valuation analysis for a number of reasons, the\\nmost important being that they help generate realistic and sound judgments of enterprise values (total\\ncompany values), they are relatively easy to use and interpret, and they can provide helpful information on a\\ncompany’s overall financial condition when used appropriately.\\nHowever, it should be noted that simplicity may have some important disadvantages. When such complex\\ninformation is reduced to a single equation or final value, it can easily be misunderstood, and the influence of\\nimportant factors may be masked or lost in the evaluation process.\\nWhat’s more, the calculation of multiples represents a snapshot in time for a firm and cannot easily show how\\na company grows or progresses. Thus, these calculations are only applicable to short-term analysis, not to\\nlong-term scenarios.\\nEquity Multiples\\nEquity multiples are especially useful for investment decisions when an investor aspires to minority positions\\nin companies. Below are some common equity multiples used in valuation analyses.\\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which we discussed earlier, is probably the most common equity multiple\\nused in stock valuation because it is relatively simple to calculate and all necessary data are easily accessible by\\nanalysts and investors. The market-to-book (M/B), or price-to-book (P/B), ratio is also useful if assets primarily\\ndrive a company’s earnings. Again, it is computed as the proportion of share price to book value per share.\\nDividend yield is another form of equity multiple and is primarily used when conducting comparisons\\nbetween cash returns and investment types. Dividend yield is computed as the proportion of dividend per\\nshare to share price. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is an additional metric used for firms that are experiencing\\nfinancial losses. The P/S ratio is often used for quick estimates and is computed as the proportion of share\\nprice to sales (or revenue) per share.\\nAnother useful metric is the price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio. The P/CF ratio is used to compare a company’s\\nmarket value to its operating cash flow (or the company’s stock price per share to its operating cash flow per\\nshare). This measurement is suitable only in certain cases, such as when a company has substantial noncash\\nexpenses (e.g., depreciation or amortization). In some situations, companies may have positive cash flows\\nbut still show a bottom-line loss due to large noncash expenses. The P/CF ratio is helpful for arriving at a less\\ndistorted view of such a company’s value.\\nWhile these various metrics are important, a financial analyst must always consider that companies often\\noperate under their own unique sets of circumstances that ultimately will influence many of these equity\\nmultiples.\\nEnterprise Value (EV) Multiples\\nThe following are some common EV multiples used in valuation analyses:\\nGordon growth model is as follows\\n11.1 • Multiple Approaches to Stock Valuation 323', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Many analysts like to use the\\ntwo-stage model because it is reasonably grounded in reality. For example, it is probably a more reasonable\\nassumption that a firm that had an initial growth rate of 10% might see its growth drop to a more modest level\\nof, say, 5% as the company becomes more established and mature, rather than assuming that the firm will\\nmaintain the initial growth rate of 10%. Experts tend to agree that firms that have higher payout ratios of\\ndividends may be well suited to the two-stage DDM.\\nAs we have seen, the assumptions of the two-stage model are as follows:\\n• The first period analyzed will be one of high initial growth.\\n• This stage of higher growth will eventually transition into a period of more mature, stable, and sustainable\\ngrowth at a lower rate than the initial high-growth period.\\n• The dividend payout ratio will be based on company performance and the expected growth rate of its\\noperations.\\nLet’s use an example. Lore Ltd. estimates that its dividend growth will be 13% per year for the next five years.\\nIt will then settle to a sustainable, constant, and continuing rate of 5%.

Also,\\nbecause the model is essentially a mathematical formula, there is little room for misinterpretation or\\nsubjectivity. As a result of these advantages, DDMs are a very popular form of stock evaluation that most\\nanalysts show faith in.\\nBecause dividends are paid in cash, companies may keep making their dividend payments even when doing so\\nis not in their best long-term interests. They may not want to manipulate dividend payments, as this can\\ndirectly lead to stock price volatility. Rather, they may manipulate dividend payments in the interest of buoying\\nup their stock price.\\nTo further illustrate limitations of DDMs, let’s examine the Concepts in Practice case.\\nCONCEPTS IN PRACTICE\\nLimitations of DDMs\\nA major limitation of the dividend discount model is that it cannot be used to value companies that do not\\npay dividends. This is becoming a growing trend, particularly for young high-tech companies. Warren\\nBuffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, has stated that companies are usually better off if they take their\\nexcess funds and reinvest them into infrastructure, evolving technologies, and other profitable ventures.\\nThe payment of dividends to shareholders is “almost a last resort for corporate management,”1 says\\nBuffett, and cash balances should be invested in “projects to become more efficient, expand territorially,\\nextend and improve product lines or . . . otherwise widen the economic moat separating the company from\\nits competitors.”2 Berkshire follows this practice of reinvesting cash rather than paying dividends, as do\\ntech companies such as Amazon, Google, and Biogen.3 So, rather than receiving cash dividends,\\nstockholders of these companies are rewarded by seeing stock price appreciation in their investments and\\nultimately large capital gains when they finally decide to sell their shares.\\nThe sensitivity of assumptions is also a drawback of using DDMs. The fair price of a stock can be highly\\nsensitive to growth rates and the required rates of return demanded by investors. A single percentage\\npoint change in either of these two factors can have a dramatic impact on a company’s stock, potentially\\nchanging it by as much as 10 to 20%.\\n1 Dan Caplinger. “Why Don’t These Winning Stocks Pay Dividends?” The Motley Fool.

He believes that he will be able to sell the stock for $25.00\\nper share. If Steve wants to earn 10% on this investment, what price should he pay today for this stock?\\nSolution:\\nThe current price of the stock is the discounted cash flow that Steve will receive over the next five years while\\nholding the stock.

The reason is that the required rate of return of the stock remained at 17% (your rate) and the growth\\nrate of the dividends remained at 13.04%. The infinite growth model gives the same price as the finite model\\nwith a future selling price as long as the required return and the growth rate are the same for all future sales\\nof the stock.\\nAlthough this point may be subtle, what we have just shown is that a stock’s price is the present value of its\\nfuture dividend stream.

The hope for capital gains is even stronger in the case of stocks that do not pay dividends. When\\nsecurities have been held for at least one year, the seller is eligible for long-term capital gains tax rates, which\\nare lower than short-term rates for most investors. This makes non-dividend-paying stocks even more\\nattractive, provided that they do indeed appreciate in value over the investor’s holding period. Meanwhile,\\nshort-term gains, or gains made on securities held for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income tax\\nrates, which are usually higher and offer no particular advantage to an investor in terms of reducing their\\ntaxes.\\nUnderstanding How the DCF Model Differs from DDMs\\nThe valuation of an asset is typically based on the present value of future cash flows that are generated by the\\nasset. It is no different with common stock, which brings us to another form of stock valuation: the\\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. Examples of such companies include Facebook, Amazon,\\nGoogle, Biogen, and Monster Beverage. The DCF model differs from the dividend discount models we covered\\nearlier, as DDM methodologies are almost entirely based on a stock’s periodic dividends.\\nThe DCF model is an absolute valuation model, meaning that it does not involve comparisons with other firms\\nwithin any specific industry but instead uses objective data to evaluate a company on a stand-alone basis. The\\nDCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows, determining the present value of the entire organization and\\nthen working this down to the share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\\nThis highly regarded methodology is the evaluation tool of choice for experienced financial analysts when\\nevaluating companies and their common stock. Many analysts prefer DCF methods of valuation because these\\nare based on a company’s cash flows, which are far less easily manipulated through accounting treatments\\nthan revenues or bottom-line earnings.\\nThe DCF model formula in its mathematical form is presented below:\\nwhere CF1 is the estimated cash flow in year 1, CF2 is the estimated cash flow in year 2, and so on; TCF is the\\nterminal cash flow, or expected cash flow from the ending asset sale; r is the discount rate or required rate of\\nreturn; g is the anticipated growth rate of the cash flow; and n is the number of years covered in the model.\\nApplying the DCF Model\\nWe can apply the DCF model to an example to demonstrate this methodology and how the formula works.\\nCalculate the value of Mayweather Inc. and its common stock based on the next six years of cash flow results.\\nAssume that the discount rate (required rate of return) is 8%, Mayweather’s growth rate is 3%, and the\\nterminal value (TCF) will be two and one-half times the discounted value of the cash flow in year 6.\\n11.3 • Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model 341', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

However, it should be noted\\nthat cash flow is not always the best means of measuring financial health. A company can always sell a large\\nportion of its assets to generate a positive cash flow, even if it is operating at a loss or experiencing other\\nfinancial difficulties. Additionally, investors prefer to see companies reinvesting their cash back into their\\nbusinesses rather than sitting on excessive balances of idle cash.\\nSimilar to other models, the discounted cash flow model is only as good as the information entered. As the\\ncommon expression goes, “garbage in, garbage out.” This can often be the case if reasonably accurate cash\\nflow estimates are not available or if an unrealistic discount rate or required rate of return is used in the\\ncalculations. It is always best to use several different methods when valuing companies and their common\\nstock.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nDiscounted Cash Flow\\nPlease view this short video on discounted cash flow (https://openstax.org/r/short_video_on_discounted)\\nand how this method can be applied in stock valuation.\\n11.4 Preferred Stock\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define preferred stock.\\n• Calculate the intrinsic value of preferred stock.\\n• Understand the difference between common stock and preferred stock.\\nFeatures of Preferred Stock\\nPreferred stock is a unique form of equity sold by some firms that offers preferential claims in ownership.\\nPreferred stock will often feature a dividend that a company is obligated to pay out before it makes any\\ndividend payments to common stockholders. In cases of bankruptcy and liquidation of the issuing company,\\npreferred stockholders have priority claim to assets before common stockholders. Additionally, preferred\\nstockholders are usually entitled to a set (or constant) dividend every period.\\nPreferred stock carries a stated par value, but unlike bonds, they have no maturity date, and consequently,\\nthere is no final payment of the par value. The only time a company would pay this par value to the\\nshareholder would be if the company ceased operations or retired the preferred stock. Many preferred stock\\nissues are cumulative in nature, meaning that if a company skips or is otherwise unable to pay a cash dividend,\\nit becomes a liability to the company and must eventually be paid out to preferred shareholders at some point\\nin the future. Other preferred stocks may be noncumulative, in which case if the company skips dividends, they\\nare forever lost to the shareholder.\\nThe term preferred comes from preferred shareholders receiving all past (if cumulative) and present dividends\\nbefore common shareholders receive any cash dividends. In other words, preferred shareholders’ dividend\\nclaims are given preferential treatment over those of common shareholders. Preferred stock is usually a form\\nof permanent funding, but there are circumstances or covenants that could alter the payoff stream.\\n11.4 • Preferred Stock 343', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

A price is efficient if the market has used all available information\\nto set it, which implies that stocks always trade at their fair value (see Figure 11.12).

The most evaluative ratios that can\\nbe computed from a company’s financial statements include the price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to book (P/B),\\nprice-to-sales (P/S), and price-to cash-flow (P/CF) ratios.\\n11.2 Dividend Discount Models (DDMs)\\nThe dividend discount model, or DDM, is a method used to value a stock based on the concept that its worth is\\nthe present value of all of its future dividends. The most common DDM is the Gordon growth model, which\\nvalues stock entirely on expected future dividends. Other techniques include the zero growth DDM, which\\ndepends on fixed dividends; the constant growth DDM, which assumes that dividends will grow at a constant\\nrate; and the variable growth or nonconstant growth DDM, which is based on the assumption that stock value\\nwill progress through different stages of growth. There is also the two-stage DDM, which is based on the\\nassumption of two stages of dividend growth: an initial period of higher growth and a subsequent period of\\nlower, more stable growth.\\n11.3 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model\\nInvestors buy stock to receive cash inflows at different points in the future. These inflows may come in the\\nform of dividends or a final cash inflow. If the investor chooses to wait for a final cash flow, the hope is that\\ncapital gains will be even stronger. The DCF model is usually used to evaluate firms that are relatively young\\nand do not pay dividends to their shareholders. The DCF model focuses on a company’s cash flows,\\ndetermining the present value of an entire organization using objective data and then working this down to\\nthe share-value level based on total shares outstanding of the subject organization.\\n11.4 Preferred Stock\\nPreferred stock is a unique form of equity sold by some firms that offers preferential claims in ownership.\\nPreferred stock carries a stated par value, but unlike bonds, there is no maturity date, and consequently, there\\nis no final payment of the par value.

Features of money market securities include being short-\\nterm (with maturities of less than one year) and very low risk (rarely failing to make their required payments).\\nFurther, money market securities are also liquid, which means that they trade easily without losing value.\\nFinancial institutions, corporations, and governments that have short-term borrowing and/or lending needs\\nissue securities in the money market. Most of the transactions are quite large, with typical amounts of $10,000,\\n$100,000, $1 million, or more. Money market securities are available in smaller amounts if you choose to invest\\nin money market mutual funds (MMMFs) or certain types of exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\\nTreasury bills (T-bills) are short-term debt instruments issued by the federal government. T-bills are\\nauctioned weekly by the Treasury Department through the trading window of the Federal Reserve Bank of\\nNew York, with maturities of 4, 8, 13, or 26 weeks. The Treasury also auctions 52-week T-bills once every four\\nweeks. The federal government uses T-bills to meet short-term liquidity needs. T-bills have very short\\nmaturities and a broad secondary market and are default-risk free. T-bills are also exempt from state and local\\nincome taxes. As a result, they carry some of the lowest effective interest rates on publicly traded debt\\nsecurities.\\nThe volume of T-bills auctioned depends upon government borrowing needs. Much of the money raised at\\nweekly T-bill auctions goes to repay the money borrowed 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks earlier. The gross amount of\\nnew T-bills issued in December 2020 was $1,591.1 billion, and the amount of T-bills retired in the same month\\nwas $1,570.6 billion, resulting in net new borrowing of “only” $20.5 billion.\\nIn addition to the regular auction of new T-bills, there is also an active secondary market where investors can\\ntrade used or previously issued T-bills. Since 2001, the average daily trading volume for T-bills has exceeded\\n$75 billion.\\nCommercial paper (CP) is a short-term, unsecured debt security issued by corporations and financial\\ninstitutions to meet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables. For example, credit card\\ncompanies use commercial paper to finance credit card payments. Commercial paper is a short-term debt\\ninstrument, with a typical maturity of 30 days and up to 270 days. The short maturity reduces US Securities and\\nExchange Commission (SEC) oversight. The lesser oversight and the unsecured nature of CP means that only\\nhighly rated firms are able to issue the uninsured paper.\\nCommercial paper typically carries a minimum face value of $100,000 and sells at a discount, with the face\\nvalue as the repayment amount. Corporations and financial institutions, not the government, issue CP; thus,\\nreturns are taxable. Further, unlike T-bills, there is not a robust secondary market for CP. Most purchasers are\\nlarge, such as mutual fund investment companies, and they tend to hold commercial paper until maturity. The\\ndefault rate on commercial paper is typically low, but default rates did increase into the double-digit range\\nduring the financial crisis of 2008.\\nNegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) are very large CDs issued by financial institutions. They are\\nredeemable only at maturity, but they can and often do trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market.\\nNCDs, or jumbo CDs, are so called because they sell in increments of $100,000 or more. However, typical\\namounts are $1 million, with a maturity of two weeks to six months.\\n354 12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The typical CD has a maturity date, interest rate, and face amount and has FDIC insurance.\\nHowever, if an investor wishes to cash out prior to maturity, they will incur a substantial penalty from the\\nissuer (bank or credit union). An NCD also has a maturity date and amount, but it is much larger than a regular\\nCD and appeals to institutional investors. The principal is not insured. When the investor wishes to cash out\\nearly, there is a robust secondary market for trading the NCD. The issuing institution can offer higher rates on\\nNCDs compared to CDs because it knows it will have use of the purchase amount for the entire maturity of the\\nNCD and because the reserve requirements on NCDs by the Federal Reserve is lower than for other types of\\ndeposits.\\nInvestment companies such as Vanguard and Fidelity, among many others, sell shares in money market\\nmutual funds (MMMFs). The investment company purchases money market instruments, such as T-bills, CP, or\\nNCDs; pools them; and then sells shares of ownership to investors (see Table 12.1). Generally, MMMFs invest\\nonly in taxable securities, such as commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit, or only in tax-\\nexempt government securities, such as T-bills. Investors can then choose which type of short-term liquid\\nsecurities they would like to hold, taxable or nontaxable.

The federal funds market traditionally\\nconsists of the overnight borrowing and lending of immediately available funds among depository financial\\ninstitutions, notably domestic commercial banks. Financial institutions such as banks are required to keep a\\nfraction of their deposits on reserve with the Fed. When banks find they are short of reserves and immediately\\nneed cash to meet reserve requirements, they can borrow directly from the Fed through the so-called\\n“discount window” or purchase excess reserves from other banks in the federal funds market. Often, the\\nmaturity of a federal funds contract is as short as a single day or overnight. The participants in the market\\nnegotiate the federal funds interest rate. However, the Federal Reserve effectively sets the target interest rate\\nrange in the federal funds market by controlling the supply of funds available for use in the market.\\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, the activities and functioning of the federal funds market has changed. The\\nfederal funds rate is still the rate targeted by the Fed for monetary policy, but the participants have evolved for\\nseveral reasons. The market now includes foreign banks and non-depository financial institutions, such as the\\nFederal Home Loan Banks. These institutions do not need to meet Fed reserve requirements and are not\\nrequired to keep reserves with the Fed. In addition, the Fed now pays interest to commercial banks for\\nreserves held at the Federal Reserve banks. Paying interest on reserves reduces the incentive for domestic\\ncommercial banks to enter the federal funds market since they can already earn interest on their excess\\nreserves.\\n12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets 355', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Investors\\ndecide how much to pay for a bond depending on how much they expect inflation to affect the value of the\\nfixed payment. There are several types of bonds: government bonds, corporate bonds, and municipal bonds.\\nGovernment Bond Markets\\nIn the section on money markets, we discussed T-bills, and we now discuss longer-term government securities\\nin the form of Treasury notes and Treasury bonds.\\nWe learned in Bonds and Bond Valuation that the federal government issues Treasury notes and bonds to\\nraise money for current spending and to repay past borrowing. The size of the Treasury market is quite large,\\nas the US federal government over the years has accumulated a total indebtedness of over $28 trillion dollars.\\nThe debt has grown so large we even have a real-time debt calculator online at https://www.usdebtclock.org/\\n(https://openstax.org/r/usdebtclock).\\nTreasury notes (T-notes) are US government debt instruments with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. The\\nTreasury auctions notes on a regular basis, and investors may purchase new notes from TreasuryDirect.gov\\n(https://openstax.org/r/treasurydirect.gov) in the same way they would a T-bill. T-notes differ from T-bills in\\nthat they are longer term and pay semiannual coupon interest payments, as well as the par or face value of\\nthe note at maturity. T-bills, as you will recall, sell at a discount and pay the face value at maturity with no\\nexplicit interest payments. Upon issue of a note, the size, number, and timing of note payments is fixed.\\nHowever, prices do change in the secondary market as interest rates change. Like T-bills, T-notes are generally\\nexempt from state and local taxes.\\nEconomists and investors keep a close eye on the 10-year T-note for several reasons. Mortgage lenders use it\\nas a basis for setting and adjusting mortgage interest rates. In general, the rate on the 10-year T-note is a\\nreliable market indicator of investor confidence.\\nThere is an active secondary market for Treasury notes. From 2001 to 2020, the daily trading volume for\\nTreasury notes has averaged $395 billion, or roughly five times the daily trading volume of T-bills. Treasury\\nnotes are the largest single type of government debt instrument, with over $11 trillion outstanding. As you can\\nsee from Figure 12.2, the Treasury dramatically increased borrowing by issuing notes following the 2008\\nfinancial crisis.\\nBrokers, dealers, and investment companies provide secondary market opportunities for individual and\\ninstitutional investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are popular investment vehicles for many types of\\ngovernment T-bill, T-note, and T-bond portfolios. An ETF is a basket of securities that can trade like stocks on a\\nstock exchange. For example, IEI is an iShares ETF managed by BlackRock that invests in Treasury securities\\nwith three to seven years to maturity. When investors buy this ETF, they purchase a small bundle of Treasury\\nnotes that they can buy or sell, just as if they owned an individual share of stock. ETFs are a convenient way for\\ninvestors to own broad portfolios of securities while still being able to trade the whole group in a single\\ntransaction if they choose.\\n2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York. “Effective Federal Funds Rate.” Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\\nhttps://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr\\n356 12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

T-bonds are like T-notes in\\nthat they pay semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the security and pay the face value at\\nmaturity. They are longer term than notes and typically have higher coupon rates. T-bonds with maturities of\\n20 and 30 years are each auctioned only once per month. At the end of 2020, there were approximately $2.8\\ntrillion of T-bonds outstanding, compared to approximately $11.1 trillion and $5 trillion of T-notes and T-bills.\\nIn 1997, the Treasury began offering a new type of longer-term debt instrument, Treasury Inflation-Protected\\nSecurities, or TIPS. TIPS currently have maturities of 5, 10, or 30 years and are auctioned by the Treasury once\\nper month. Like T-notes and T-bonds, they offer semiannual coupon interest payments for the life of the\\nsecurity and pay face value at maturity. The coupon interest rates are fixed, but the principal value adjusts\\nmonthly in response to changes in the consumer price index (CPI). Inflation and deflation cause the value of\\nthe principal to increase or decrease, which results in a larger or smaller semiannual coupon payment. With a\\ntotal outstanding value of approximately $1.6 trillion at the end of 2020, TIPS are the smallest form of Treasury\\nborrowing we have discussed.3\\nState and local governments and taxing districts can issue debt in the form of municipal bonds (munis). Local\\nborrowing carries more risk than Treasury securities, and default or bankruptcy is atypical but possible. Thus,\\nmunis have ratings that run a spectrum similar to corporate bonds in that they receive a bond rating based on\\nthe perceived default risk. The defining feature of municipal bonds is that some interest payments are tax-\\nfree. Interest on munis (municipal bonds) is always exempt from federal taxes and sometimes exempt from\\nstate and local taxes. This makes them very attractive to investors in high income brackets.\\nThere are two primary types of municipal bonds: revenue bonds and general obligation (GO) bonds. GO bonds\\ngenerate cash flows to repay the bonds by taxing a project. For instance, a local school district may tax\\nresidents to pay for capital construction, or a city may tax citizens to pay for a new public works building.\\nRevenue bonds, on the other hand, may apply to projects that generate sufficient cash flows to repay the\\nbond—perhaps a utility or local toll road.\\nCorporate Bond Markets\\nJust as governments borrow money in the long-term from investors, so do corporations. A corporation often\\nuses bank loans, commercial paper, or supplier credit for short-term borrowing needs and issues bonds for\\nlonger-term financing. Bond contracts identify very specific terms of agreement and outline the rules for the\\norder, timing, and amount of contractual payments, as well as processes for when one or more of the required\\nactivities lapse. Indenture is the legal term for a bond contract. The indenture also includes limitations on the\\n3 Nick Lioudis. “Where Can I Buy Government Bonds?” Investopedia.

Because of these non-standardized features of a bond contract, the secondary market for\\ntrading used bonds typically requires a broker, dealer, or investment company to facilitate a trade.\\nWhen a corporation uses a real asset, such as property or buildings, to guarantee a bond, the firm has issued a\\nmortgage bond. However, it is more common for a corporation to issue an unsecured bond known as a\\ndebenture. The risk of a debenture reflects the risk of the entire corporation and does not rely on the value of\\na specific underlying asset, as is the case with a mortgage bond.\\nThe risk a bondholder bears for buying a bond depends in part on the terms of the bond indenture, market\\nconditions over the life of the bond contract, and the ability or inability of the firm to generate sufficient cash\\nflows to meet its bond obligations. Fortunately, investors do not have to make these determinations about risk\\non their own. They can rely on bond rating services such as Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, or Fitch to generate\\nevaluations of the creditworthiness of bond issuers.\\nRatings firms must adhere to rigorous standards when evaluating client creditworthiness. For example,\\nStandard and Poor’s begins the explanation of its evaluation process with these paragraphs:\\n“S&P Global Ratings provides a Credit Rating only when, in its opinion, there is information of satisfactory\\nquality to form a credible opinion on creditworthiness, consistent with its Quality of the Rating Process –\\nSufficient Information (Quality of Information) Policy, and only after applicable quantitative, qualitative, and\\nlegal analyses are performed. Throughout the ratings and surveillance process, the analytical team reviews\\ninformation from both public and nonpublic sources.”\\n“For corporate, government, and financial services company or entity (collectively referred to as “C&G” Credit\\nRatings), the analysis generally includes historical and projected financial information, industry and/or\\neconomic data, peer comparisons, and details on planned financings. In addition, the analysis is based on\\nqualitative factors, such as the institutional or governance framework, the financial strategy of the rated entity\\nand, generally, the experience and credibility of management.”4\\nTable 12.2 is a summary of how the three major credit rating agencies identify their ratings. Bond ratings are\\nimportant for many reasons. The higher a firm’s rating, the lower the expected default risk and the lower the\\ncost of borrowing for the firm. Pension funds may be restricted to investing in only medium- or higher-grade\\nbonds. This could limit the number of investors who can participate in the market for lower-grade bonds,\\nthereby reducing the liquidity, price, and tradability of those debt securities.\\nThere are only two US companies with AAA credit ratings: Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson.5 Over the past 40\\nyears, there has been a steady decline of AAA-rated companies (from sixty in 1980). Many institutions have\\nfound that this rating requires a more conservative approach to debt that can inhibit growth and revenue. So,\\nin today’s market, credit ratings have begun to lose their importance.

For corporations, shares of stock\\nrepresent ownership. A corporation could have 100 shares, one million shares, or even several billion shares of\\nstock. Stocks are difficult to value compared to bonds. Bonds typically provide periodic interest payments and\\na principal payment at maturity. The bond indenture specifies the timing and the amount of payments. Stocks\\nmight have periodic dividend payments, and an investor can plan to sell the stock at some point in the future.\\nHowever, no contract guarantees the size of the dividends or the time and resale price of the stock. Thus, the\\ncash flows from stock ownership are more uncertain and risky.\\nCorporations are the dominant form of business enterprise in the United States because of the ability to raise\\ncapital, the ease of transfer of ownership, and the benefit of limited liability to the owners. There are generally\\ntwo types of stock, preferred and common. Preferred stock is a hybrid between common stock and bonds.\\nPreferred stock has a higher claim to cash flows than common stockholders have (thus the term preferred),\\nbut it is lower than that of bondholders. In addition, preferred stock has fixed cash flows as bonds have and\\ntypically has no or few voting rights. Preferred stock dividends are after-tax payments by the corporation, as\\nare common stock dividends, but bond interest payments, paid prior to taxes, are tax-deductible for firms. Of\\nthe three, preferred stock is the least used form of capital financing for corporations.\\nCommon stockholders are the residual claimants and owners of the corporation. After all others who have a\\nclaim against the firm are paid, the common stockholders own all that remains. Common stockholders have\\nvoting rights, typically one vote per share, and choose the board of directors.\\nOne popular way to rank the size of companies is to determine the value of their market capitalization, or\\nmarket cap. Market cap is equal to the current stock price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.\\nAccording to the World Bank, the total market cap of US firms at the end of 2020 was $50.8 trillion, making up\\nover half of the world’s total value of equity, estimated at $90 trillion.6 The largest US company at that time\\nwas Apple, followed by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Facebook. The largest company by sales\\nvolume in 2020 was Walmart.7\\nGeographical Location of Exchanges\\nOwnership is easily transferable for stocks that trade in one of the organized stock exchanges or in an over-\\nthe-counter (OTC) market. Definitions of a stock exchange and an OTC market blur as financial markets quickly\\nadapt to innovations. However, stock markets have a centralized trading location, transactions require a\\nbroker to connect buyers and sellers, and the exchanges guarantee a basic level of liquidity so that investors\\nare always able to buy or sell their stocks. An OTC market is an electronic market conducted on computer\\nscreens and consists of direct transactions among buyers and sellers, with no broker to bring the two\\n6 Siblis Research. “Total Market Value of US Stock Market.” Siblis Research. https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/;\\nThe World Bank. “Market Capitalization of Listed Domestic Companies (current US$).” The World Bank. https://data.worldbank.org/\\nindicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD\\n7 Companies Market Cap. “Largest American Companies by Market Capitalization.” Companies Market Cap.\\nhttps://companiesmarketcap.com/usa/largest-companies-in-the-usa-by-market-cap/; National Retail Federation. “Top 100 Retailers\\n2020 List.” National Retail Federation. 2020. https://nrf.com/resources/top-retailers/top-100-retailers/top-100-retailers-2020-list\\n12.1 • Overview of US Financial Markets 359', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Because there is no formal exchange present, it is possible that investors will have trouble finding\\nbuyers or sellers for their stocks.\\nMost of the trading consists of used or previously issued stocks in over-the-counter markets and organized\\nexchanges. The two largest stock exchanges in the world, as measured by the market capitalization of the\\ncompanies listed on the exchange, are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. Both exchanges\\nare located in the United States. Other large stock exchanges are located in Japan, China, Hong Kong,\\ncontinental Europe, London, and Saudi Arabia.\\nProcess of Offering Equities\\nThe primary market is the market for new securities, and the secondary market is the market for used\\nsecurities. When issuing new equity, the issuing firm receives the proceeds of the sale. Having an active\\nsecondary market makes it easier for corporations to issue stock, as investors know they can resell if desired.\\nMost of the trading of equity securities is for used securities on the secondary market.\\nAn initial public offering, or IPO, occurs when a firm offers stock to the public for the first time. With a typical\\nIPO, a private company decides to raise capital and go public with the help of an investment banker. The\\ninvestment banker agrees to provide financial advice, recommend the price and number of shares to issue,\\nand establish a syndicate of underwriters to finance and ultimately distribute the new shares to investors (see\\nFigure 12.3). An IPO is expensive for the issuing firm, and it can expect to incur costs of 5% to 8% or more of\\nthe value of the IPO. As of the end of 2020, the largest successful IPO belongs to Saudi Aramco, a petroleum\\ncompany, valued at $25.6 billion at issue in December 2019.8 The Ant Group had planned an IPO valued at\\nover $34 billion dollars in 2020, but as of the end of 2020 that issue was put on hold by the Chinese\\ngovernment.9\\nInstitutional and preferred individual investors are typically the initial purchasers of IPOs. Smaller investors\\nrarely have the opportunity to purchase. However, any investor can buy the new shares once available for\\npublic trading. Investment author and financial expert Professor Burton Malkiel cautions that buying IPOs\\nimmediately after issue can be a money-losing investment. He cites research showing that, historically, IPOs\\nhave underperformed the market by an average of 4% per year.10\\nAnother way for a corporation to raise capital in the equity market is through a seasoned equity offering\\n(SEO). An IPO occurs when a firm transitions from a private to a public company. An SEO takes place when a\\ncorporation that is already publicly traded issues additional shares of stock to the public. An SEO is often part\\nof a SEC Rule 415 offering, or so-called shelf registration. Shelf registrations allow a company to register with\\nthe SEC to issue new shares but wait up to two years before issuing the shares. This gives companies the\\nability to register their intent to issue new shares and to “set them on the shelf” until market conditions are\\nmost favorable for issuance to the public.\\n8 Jennifer Rudden. “Largest IPOs Worldwide as of January 21, 2021.” Statista. 2021. https://www.statista.com/statistics/269343/\\nworlds-largest-ipos/\\n9 Deborah D’Souza. “Ant Group Set to Be World’s Largest IPO Ever.” Investopedia.

We know that firms with products or services to sell and a documented operational\\nand financial history often initiate an IPO to raise money by going public. A SPAC, however, is like an IPO that\\nputs the cart before the horse. By this, we mean that rather than having a company ready to go public to raise\\ncapital, with a SPAC, a sponsor raises capital in anticipation of finding a firm ready to go public. This is why we\\nsometimes refer to SPACs as “blank check” companies. Investors are providing capital to a firm that has no\\nassets with the expectation that the sponsor will find a good investment.\\nForming a SPAC shifts the risk and expenses associated with a firm going public. Because the money raised by\\nthe SPAC sponsor is the only asset, the process of filing with the SEC is less complicated, less expensive, and\\nless time-consuming than filing an IPO. Often, when formed, a SPAC has a target company in mind, but this is\\nnot a requirement. Once the SPAC identifies a target firm, the sponsor can negotiate a purchase price and\\nessentially merge with the target. Underpricing of IPOs is well documented,12 and the owners of a private\\ncompany going public do not capture the significant increase in stock price that frequently occurs in the\\nmonths following an IPO.\\nA SPAC offering allows the private firm owners to negotiate for a better price. A July 2020 study from\\nRenaissance Capital reports that “of 223 SPAC IPOs conducted from the start of 2015 through July 2020, 89\\nhave completed mergers and taken a company public.” According to the study, of those 89 mergers, “the\\ncommon shares have delivered an average loss of 18.8% and a median return of minus 36.1%. That compares\\nwith the average after-market return from traditional IPOs of 37.2%” over the same time period.13\\nSequence of Trade Execution\\nInvestors who wish to trade stocks (buy or sell) execute trades via a broker.

So which is the riskier asset?”14 Siegel brings up a valid point\\nabout inflation. Returns adjusted for changes in prices provide a better measure of value or wealth. Baseball\\npundit Sam Ewing noted, “Inflation is when you pay fifteen dollars for the ten-dollar haircut you used to get\\nfor five dollars when you had hair.”15 If what you have earned on your investments fails to keep up with\\nchanging prices, you may have a larger portfolio with less purchasing power.\\nExpected versus Actual Inflation\\nInflation occurs when things cost more and your money buys less today than it did yesterday. It is\\nunderstandable to dislike inflation and to be concerned over the prospect of rising prices. In fact, two of the\\nprimary policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to work for price stability and moderate interest rates.\\nHowever, is inflation necessarily good or bad? In practice, inflation can benefit some people and harm others\\nat the same time. Consider the impact of differences in expected and actual realized inflation. Empirical\\nevidence suggests that, on average, economists do a good job of developing inflation rate forecasts that\\nmatch the actual rate of inflation. Estimated inflation is built into the interest rates investors require or are\\nwilling to pay for financial products, such as fixed-rate loans or bonds. When the actual rate of inflation\\nexceeds the estimated rate on a product, such as a mortgage loan, this means borrowers are repaying the\\nloan with less-valuable dollars and benefit from the increased inflation rate. Lenders, however, receive those\\ninflation-impacted dollars and are harmed due to their unexpected decrease in purchasing power.\\nDeflation, or falling prices, is associated with economic recessions or even depressions and is thought to be an\\neven more serious problem than inflation. Generally, policy makers tend to support moderate inflation, being\\ncareful to stay away from zero or negative price changes.\\n14 Jeremy J. Siegel.

Lenders providing fixed-rate loans receive less-valuable dollars in\\nreturn. Borrowers repay with those same less-valuable dollars. Workers receive less-valuable dollars, especially\\nwhen their wage increases lag behind changes in prices. Modest inflation can benefit a consumer-driven\\neconomy like the United States if consumers are motivated to spend money before prices increase. However,\\ntoo much inflation can cause frenzied buying, drive prices even higher, and outpace the rate of wage\\nincreases. Higher inflation raises the rates on new borrowing instruments and can slow the rate of business\\ninvestment and economic growth. Inflation raises overall prices and may cause hardship for consumers on a\\nfixed income.\\nFinally, inflation does not have an equal impact on all goods and services. As Table 12.3 shows, consumer\\nprices did not increase at the same rate for the selected items shown. From 1980 to 2020, inflation, as\\nmeasured by the consumer price index (CPI), grew at an average annual rate of 2.90%. However, the price of\\ncollege tuition and fees increased at more than double that rate. Rent, another large expense for most college\\nstudents, increased at an annual rate of 3.67%, also well above the average increase in the CPI. The price\\nincreases for ground beef and butter were slightly less than the CPI average. For the selected items presented\\nhere, only the average price for used cars and trucks rose at a rate significantly lower than the average rate of\\ninflation.\\nYear 1980 2000 2020 Annual Change\\nCollege tuition and fees 70.8 331.9 877.3 6.49%\\nRent 80.9 183.9 341.5 3.67%\\nUsed cars and trucks 62.3 155.8 144.2 2.12%\\nGround beef 104.6 125.2 296.2 2.64%\\nButter 89.4 135.9 248.7 2.59%\\nCPI (1982 to 1984 = 100) 82.4 172.2 258.8 2.90%\\nTable 12.3 Changing Consumer Price Levels—Selected Goods (source:\\nUS Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index)\\nUsing Graphs and Charts to Plot Inflation Behavior\\nThe CPI is a measure of how prices have changed for a basket of goods across the United States. Figure 12.5\\nshows the eight major categories of expenditures included in the CPI.16 Different regions of the country and\\npopulation subgroups may experience different rates of inflation. Retired people may spend a greater portion\\nof their income on healthcare than someone in their twenties.17 Residents on the East and West Coasts spend\\na higher percentage of their earnings on housing than those living in the Midwest.18 As such, there are several\\ndifferent measures of inflation based on geographic region or other factors.19 It is worth noting that a basket\\nof goods and services that cost $100 in 1984 would cost approximately $260 by the end of 2020, an increase of\\n160% (see Figure 12.6)! Over that same period, the average annual rate of inflation as measured by the CPI\\nwas 2.55%. These numbers make it easy to see that even a relatively modest annual inflation rate, lower than\\nthe long-run annual US inflation rate of 3%, results in significant price increases.\\n16 US Bureau of Labor Statistics. “Consumer Price Index.” US Bureau of Labor Statistics. https://www.bls.gov/cpi/\\n17 Chris Farrell. “The Truth About Health Care Costs in Retirement.” Forbes.

She changed her major to economics, and the rest, as they say, is history.\\nIn her first stint working with the Federal Reserve in 1977, Yellen met and married George Ackerlof. Ackerlof\\nwould go on to win a Nobel Prize in Economics. Ackerlof and Yellen eventually established themselves as\\nfaculty members at the University of California, Berkeley. Yellen was twice named Outstanding Teacher in\\nthe Haas School of Business and was recognized for her award-winning research.\\nIn 1993, Yellen began her second tour at the Federal Reserve as an appointed member of the Board of\\nGovernors. She left this position in 1997 to head President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers. Yellen\\nbecame just the second woman to head the presidential council.\\nShe then returned to California and the Bay Area, eventually becoming president of the Federal Reserve\\nBank of San Francisco from 2004 to 2010. Later that year she became the vice chair of the Federal Reserve.\\nFour years later, in 2014, Yellen assumed leadership as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve System.\\nAs Fed chair, Yellen earned an enviable record.

In fact, T-bonds often\\nserve as the proxy for a risk-free investment in financial modeling. However, even though T-bonds may be\\nessentially default-risk free, they do change value as interest rates change. Look at Figure 12.8, showing\\nannual T-bond returns from 1980 to 1999. None of these bonds defaulted, yet investors realized very different\\nreturns on their investments from year to year. The total returns reflect interest payments plus the change in\\nprice because of changes in interest rates.\\nThe late 1970s experienced high rates of inflation and interest rates. As those rates began to fall in late 1981,\\nbond prices rose. Investors holding T-bond portfolios realized very large returns on their risk-free investments\\nin 1982. That year provided the highest annual return in the 20-year period, with an annual return of 32.81%.\\nThe lowest annual return was in 1999, as the Federal Reserve began to raise rates to temper an overheating\\nstock market caused by dot-com speculation gaining momentum. When the Fed raised interest rates, the\\nprices on existing bonds fell, and investors realized a -8.25% return on their bond portfolios. Thus, the range in\\nreturns on these “low risk” investment securities was over 41% from the highest to the lowest annual return in\\nthis particular two-decade span. Overall, the average annual return on T-bonds from 1980 to 1999 was a robust\\n10.21%, boosted in part by the above average annual inflation rate of 4.28%.\\n366 12 • Historical Performance of US Markets\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

With reduced variability of interest rates in the new century and interest rates in general being\\nlower, the returns on bond portfolios were also lower on average. T-bonds in the first two decades of the\\ntwenty-first century averaged an annual return of 5.77%, very close to the long-run average return in the\\nprevious century. The range of returns was also smaller than the previous two decades, with the highest\\nannual return topping out at 20.10% in 2008 and the lower end dipping down to -11.12% in 2009 as the Fed\\nmade a significant effort to reduce interest rates in an attempt to stimulate the economy following the Great\\nRecession.\\nCorporate Bond Behavior, Discussion, Charts, and Graphs\\nThe performance of Baa bonds is very similar to T-Bonds over the four decades spanning 1980 to 2020 (see\\nFigure 12.10). These bonds are not default-risk free and require a risk premium for investors. The average\\nannual return of 12.07% from 1980 to 1999 topped T-bonds by 1.86%. The margin was greater in the period\\nfrom 2000 to 2020 (see Figure 12.11), with Baa bonds (mid-tier corporate bonds) realizing an average annual\\npremium of 2.30% over the default-risk free T-bonds.\\nThese premiums translate to a substantial increase in investment performance. For example, had an investor\\nplaced $100 into a T-bond portfolio in 1980, the value of the investment would have been $1,931 by year-end\\n2020. This would have easily outpaced the rate of inflation but significantly lagged the ending value of $4,506\\non a similar Baa bond portfolio investment (see Figure 12.12).\\n12.3 • Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds 367', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

In over 40 years of investing in bonds and other types of fixed-\\nincome securities worldwide, Bill Gross earned his moniker “the bond king.”\\nIn 1971, Gross cofounded and began his long tenure as managing director and chief investment officer of\\nPacific Investment Management Company, better known as Pimco. Gross was not yet 30 years old, but he\\nhad already graduated from college, served in the Navy in Vietnam, and even briefly worked as a\\nprofessional blackjack player in Las Vegas to bankroll the cost of his MBA from UCLA.\\nGross helped change the definition of success for bond investors by focusing on total returns, including\\nprice changes, rather than simply bond yields. He used mathematical modeling and invested worldwide\\nand in different types of bond markets seeking risk-adjusted returns. Gross made active rather than passive\\nmanagement of bond funds a successful investment strategy. In the process, he changed how mangers\\noversee fixed-income portfolios today.\\nPimco grew into an investment powerhouse under Gross’s direction, eventually managing over $1.5 trillion\\ndollars in assets. During the financial crisis of 2008, Gross served as an adviser to the US Treasury.\\nMorningstar named him “fixed income fund manager of the decade” in 2010. In addition, Gross profited\\nfrom his investment prowess, amassing a fortune in excess of $2 billion.\\nGross’s investment strategy was to carefully analyze the known factors about debt instruments and pair\\nthat analysis with the unknown future. He was uncanny in his ability to estimate future prices, interest\\nrates, and macroeconomic conditions to make profitable investments.\\nHowever, as efficient markets would posit, the odds began to catch up with Gross in the latter part of his\\ninvesting career. After leaving Pimco in 2014, Gross was unable to match his earlier performance successes\\nand failed to beat bond fund performance averages. Much of Gross’s investment strategy allowed him to\\nlook for bond returns by investing in any type of bond, with any maturity, in any country, and in any\\nlocation. For decades, he was right more often than wrong in his investment choices. However, statistically,\\n12.3 • Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds 369', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Both indices\\ntrack the change in value of a group of large capitalization stocks. The changes in the two indices are highly\\ncorrelated.\\nIt may be fair to question if either index is a good representation of the value of equity and the changes in\\nvalue in the market because there are over 6,000 publicly traded companies listed on organized exchanges\\nand thousands of additional companies that trade only over the counter. As of year-end 2020, the S&P 500\\nfirms had a combined market capitalization of $33.4 trillion, about 66% of the estimated US equity market\\ncapitalization of $50.8 trillion.20 It is widely agreed that the performance of the S&P 500 is a good\\nrepresentation of the broader market and more specifically of large capitalization firms.\\nFigure 12.13 provides a visualization of how S&P 500 stock returns have stacked up since 1900. This figure\\nmakes it clear that equity returns roughly follow a bell curve, or normal distribution. Thus, we are able to\\nmeasure risk with standard deviation. A lower standard deviation of returns suggests less uncertainty of\\nreturns and therefore less risk.\\nCapital market history demonstrates that the average return to stocks has significantly outperformed other\\nfinancial security classes, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or the money market.

An entrepreneur from an early age, Buffett’s yearbook photo caption noted that he\\n“likes math: a future stockbroker.” Before leaving high school, Buffett had already earned thousands of\\ndollars running a paper route and through one of his start-up businesses of installing and maintaining\\npinball machines in barbershops.\\nAs they say in Nebraska, “you need to make hay while the sun shines,” and Buffett has made his share of\\nhay, so to speak. In his career, Buffett has accumulated enough hay to be one of the wealthiest people in\\nthe world, with a net worth of over $80 billion by the end of 2020.\\nThe “Oracle of Omaha,” as Buffett is known, grew his fortune through investing partnerships and most\\nnotably as the chairman, president, CEO, and largest stockholder of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK). Berkshire\\nHathaway was a New England textile manufacturer when Buffett and his investment partners began buying\\nshares in the 1960s. By 1966, after a dispute with the then CEO of Berkshire, Buffett assumed control of the\\ncompany and fired the CEO. Soon, Buffett’s partnerships merged into Berkshire and moved the business\\naway from textiles; it eventually became the largest financial services company in the world, including total\\nownership of the Geico Insurance Company.\\nBuffett’s career is notable for how he developed his fortune, how he explained his philosophy, and for his\\ncurrent and future plans. Buffett followed the method of Benjamin Graham, famous value investor and\\nauthor of Security Analysis, The Intelligent Investor. However, Buffett expanded beyond Graham’s analysis\\n12.4 • Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks 373', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

He applied\\nthe same criteria to hiring employees as well. Buffett once noted, “We look for three things when we hire\\npeople. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we look for integrity. And if they don’t\\nhave the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you’re going to get someone without integrity, you want\\nthem lazy and dumb.” When speaking of integrity, Buffett went on to say, “Only when the tide goes out do\\nyou discover who’s been swimming naked.”\\nBuffett’s folksy way of making his point will undoubtedly be another of his legacies. When asked repeatedly\\nabout how he managed to be such a successful investor, Buffett replied, “Never invest in a business you\\ncan’t understand.” Never was this truer than in the late 1990s and 2000, when the dot-com craze fueled the\\nstock market with technology firms enjoying tremendous price increases without the corresponding\\nearnings. Buffett’s value investing lagged until the bubble burst, and suddenly he was back on top. When\\nasked about his change in fortune he replied, “In the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer\\nthan the windshield.”\\nBuffett believes in long-term rather than short-term investing. He once remarked that “Someone’s sitting in\\nthe shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago” and “If you aren’t willing to own a stock\\nfor 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for 10 minutes.”\\nThe third aspect of Buffett’s legacy will be how his money works now and after he is gone. With Bill and\\nMelinda Gates, Buffett started the Giving Pledge, and to date they have gathered the pledge of over 200\\nbillionaires to give away half or more of their fortune during and after their lifetimes. Buffett states, “If\\nyou’re in the luckiest 1% of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99%.”\\nBuffett has begun the process to give away most of his fortune, but he has left this pearl of wisdom for his\\nown children: “A very rich person should leave his kids enough to do anything, but not enough to do\\nnothing.”\\n(Sources: Joshua Kennon. “How Warren Buffett Became One of the Wealthiest People in America.” The\\nBalance.

With this dichotomy, we\\nexplored the money market and the capital market. The money market consists of short-term securities and\\nthe capital market of longer-term securities. The capital market discussion focused on debt and equity as\\nfinancial instruments used to finance longer-term capital financing needs. IPOs or SPACs are vehicles for\\nraising new equity. Most trading on organized exchanges or over-the-counter markets is for used, or\\nsecondary, securities.\\n12.2 Historical Picture of Inflation\\nThe Federal Reserve considers moderate inflation rates optimal in their oversight of the US economy. We\\nmeasure inflation by comparing the price of a bundle or basket of goods over time and documenting how\\nprices change. Since not everyone consumes similar baskets of goods, we calculate several different measures\\nof inflation. The most commonly quoted measure of inflation uses changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\\n12.3 Historical Picture of Returns to Bonds\\nHistorical bond yields are published going back hundreds of years but are only reliably available for the last\\n100 years or so. In large part, the returns realized on portfolios of bonds have been smaller and less variable\\nthan the returns realized for equities.\\n12.4 Historical Picture of Returns to Stocks\\nStocks have produced the greatest average annual rates of return of the money and capital market assets\\ndiscussed in this chapter. Stockholders bear more risk than bondholders or money market investors and\\nreceive on average higher average annual returns. Despite the relatively high average annual rate of return for\\nportfolios of stock, history shows that the equity markets earn negative annual returns about 25% of the time.\\nThe negative returns realized by equities occur far more often than the negative results realized by money\\nmarket or debt market instruments.\\nKey Terms\\nbond returns sums the periodic interest payments and the change in bond price in a given period and\\ndivides by the bond price at the beginning of the period\\ncommercial paper (CP) a short-term, unsecured security issued by corporations and financial institutions to\\nmeet short-term financing needs such as inventory and receivables\\ndebenture a common type of unsecured bond issued by a corporation\\nindenture legal term for a bond contract\\ninflation a general increase in prices and a reduction in purchasing power; expected rate is a key component\\nof interest rates\\ninitial public offering (IPO) the first time a firm offers stock to the public\\nmortgage bond bond issued by a corporation using a real asset, such as property or buildings, to guarantee\\nit\\nmunicipal bonds (munis) bonds issued by a local government, territory, or agency; generally used to\\nfinance infrastructure projects\\nnegotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) large CDs issued by financial institutions; redeemable at maturity\\nbut can trade prior to maturity in a broad secondary market\\nprimary market market for new securities\\nseasoned equity offering (SEO) a method used by new IPOs to raise capital by offering additional shares of\\nstock to the public\\nsecondary market market for used securities\\n376 12 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The most widely used measures of the center of a\\ndata set are the mean (average), median, and mode. The arithmetic mean is the most common measure of the\\naverage. We will discuss the geometric mean later.\\nNote that the words mean and average are often used interchangeably. The substitution of one word for the\\nother is common practice. The technical term is arithmetic mean, and average technically refers only to a\\ncenter location. Formally, the arithmetic mean is called the first moment of the distribution by\\nmathematicians. However, in practice among non-statisticians, average is commonly accepted as a synonym\\nfor arithmetic mean.\\nTo calculate the arithmetic mean value of 50 stock portfolios, add the 50 portfolio dollar values together and\\ndivide the sum by 50. To calculate the arithmetic mean for a set of numbers, add the numbers together and\\nthen divide by the number of data values.\\nIn statistical analysis, you will encounter two types of data sets: sample data and population data. Population\\ndata represents all the outcomes or measurements that are of interest. Sample data represents outcomes or\\nmeasurements collected from a subset, or part, of the population of interest.\\nThe notation is used to indicate the sample mean, where the arithmetic mean is calculated based on data\\ntaken from a sample. The notation is used to denote the sum of the data values, and is used to indicate\\nthe number of data values in the sample, also known as the sample size.\\nThe sample mean can be calculated using the following formula:\\nFinance professionals often rely on averages of Treasury bill auction amounts to determine their value.

For example, to find the median value of 50 portfolios, find the number that splits the\\ndata into two equal parts. The portfolio values owned by 25 people will be below the median, and 25 people\\nwill have portfolio values above the median. The median is generally a better measure of the average when\\nthere are extreme values or outliers in the data set.\\nAn outlier or extreme value is a data value that is significantly different from the other data values in a data\\nset. The median is preferred when outliers are present because the median is not affected by the numerical\\nvalues of the outliers.\\nThe ordered data set from Table 13.1 appears as follows:\\nThe middle value in this ordered data set is the third data value, which is 39.7. Thus, the median is $39.7 billion.\\nYou can quickly find the location of the median by using the expression . The variable n represents the\\ntotal number of data values in the sample. If n is an odd number, the median is the middle value of the data\\nvalues when ordered from smallest to largest. If n is an even number, the median is equal to the two middle\\nvalues of the ordered data values added together and divided by 2. In the example from Table 13.1, there are\\nfive data values, so n = 5. To identify the position of the median, calculate , which is , or 3. This\\nindicates that the median is located in the third data position, which corresponds to the value 39.7.\\nAs mentioned earlier, when outliers are present in a data set, the mean can be nonrepresentative of the center\\nof the data set, and the median will provide a better measure of center. The following Think It Through\\nexample illustrates this point.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nFinding the Measure of Center\\nSuppose that in a small village of 50 people, one person earns a salary of $5 million per year, and the other\\n49 individuals each earn $30,000. Which is the better measure of center: the mean or the median?\\nSolution:\\nThe mean, in dollars, would be arrived at mathematically as follows:\\nHowever, the median would be $30,000. There are 49 people who earn $30,000 and one person who earns\\n$5,000,000.\\nThe median is a better measure of the “average” than the mean because 49 of the values are $30,000 and\\none is $5,000,000. The $5,000,000 is an outlier. The $30,000 gives us a better sense of the middle of the data\\nset.\\n13.1 • Measures of Center 383', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more\\nvariation.\\nSuppose that we are studying the variability of two different stocks, Stock A and Stock B.

For example, if you\\nknow the standard deviation of a data set is 12.5, you can calculate the variance by squaring this standard\\ndeviation. The variance is then 12.52, which is 156.25.\\nIn the same way, if you know the value of the variance, you can determine the standard deviation by\\ncalculating the square root of the variance. For example, if the variance of a data set is known to be 31.36, then\\nthe standard deviation can be calculated as the square root of 31.36, which is 5.6.\\n13.2 • Measures of Spread 389', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The standard deviation is measured in\\nthe same units as the original data set, and thus the standard deviation is used more commonly than the\\nvariance to measure the spread of a data set.\\n13.3 Measures of Position\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define and calculate z-scores for a measurement.\\n• Define and calculate quartiles and percentiles for a data set.\\n• Use quartiles as a method to detect outliers in a data set.\\nz-Scores\\nA z-score, also called a z-value, is a measure of the position of an entry in a data set. It represents the number\\nof standard deviations by which a data value differs from the mean. For example, suppose that in a certain\\nyear, the rates of return for various technology-focused mutual funds are examined, and the mean return is\\n7.8% with a standard deviation of 2.3%. A certain mutual fund publishes its rate of return as 12.4%. Based on\\nthis rate of return of 12.4%, we can calculate the relative standing of this mutual fund compared to the other\\ntechnology-focused mutual funds. The corresponding z-score of a measurement considers the given\\nmeasurement in relation to the mean and standard deviation for the entire population.\\nThe formula for a z-score calculation is as follows:\\nwhere x is the measurement, is the mean, and is the standard deviation.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nInterpreting a z-Score\\nA certain technology-based mutual fund reports a rate of return of 12.4% for a certain year, while the mean\\nrate of return for comparable funds is 7.8% and the standard deviation is 2.3%. Calculate and interpret the\\nz-score for this particular mutual fund.\\nSolution:\\nIn this example, the measurement and Using the z-score formula, the\\ncalculation is performed as follows:\\nThe resulting z-score indicates the number of standard deviations by which a particular measurement is\\nabove or below the mean. In this example, the rate of return for this particular mutual fund is 2 standard\\ndeviations above the mean, indicating that this mutual fund generated a significantly better rate of return\\nthan all other technology-based mutual funds for the same time period.\\nQuartiles and Percentiles\\nIf a person takes an IQ test, their resulting score might be reported as in the 87th percentile. This percentile\\nindicates the person’s relative performance compared to others taking the IQ test. A person scoring in the\\n87th percentile has an IQ score higher than 87% of all others taking the test.

Quartiles divide\\nordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths.

It means that 90% of the test\\nscores are the same as or less than your score and the remaining 10% of the scores are the same as or greater\\nthan your score.\\nPercentiles are useful for comparing values. In a finance example, a mutual fund might report that the\\nperformance for the fund over the past year was in the 80th percentile of all mutual funds in the peer group.\\nThis indicates that the fund performed better than 80% of all other funds in the peer group.

The upper half of the\\ndata values are 7.4, 7.5, 7.9, 8.2, 8.7, which are the data values above the median.)\\nTo find the first quartile, Q1, locate the middle value of the lower half of the data. The middle value of the lower\\nhalf of the data set is 6.3. Notice that one-fourth, or 25%, of the data values are below this first quartile, and\\n75% of the data values are above this first quartile.\\nTo find the third quartile, Q3, locate the middle value of the upper half of the data. The middle value of the\\nupper half of the data set is 7.9. Notice that one-fourth, or 25%, of the data values are above this third quartile,\\nand 75% of the data values are below this third quartile.\\nThe interquartile range (IQR) is a number that indicates the spread of the middle half, or the middle 50%, of\\nthe data. It is the difference between the third quartile, Q3, and the first quartile, Q1.\\nIn the above example, the IQR can be calculated as\\nOutlier Detection\\nQuartiles and the IQR can be used to flag possible outliers in a data set. For example, if most employees at a\\ncompany earn about $50,000 and the CEO of the company earns $2.5 million, then we consider the CEO’s\\nsalary to be an outlier data value because is significantly different from all the other salaries in the data set. An\\noutlier data value can also be a value much lower than the other data values, so if one employee only makes\\n$15,000, then this employee’s low salary might also be considered an outlier.\\nTo detect outliers, use the quartiles and the IQR to calculate a lower and an upper bound for outliers. Then any\\ndata values below the lower bound or above the upper bound will be flagged as outliers.

A normal curve can be drawn to represent this scenario, in which the mean of $60,000\\nwould be plotted on the horizontal axis, corresponding to the peak of the curve. Then, to find the probability\\nthat an employee earns more than $75,000, you would calculate the area under the normal curve to the right\\nof the data value $75,000.\\nExcel uses the following command to find the area under the normal curve to the left of a specified value:\\n=NORM.DIST(XVALUE, MEAN, STANDARD_DEV, TRUE)\\nFor example, at the financial consulting company mentioned above, the mean employee salary is $60,000 with\\na standard deviation of $7,500. To find the probability that a random employee’s salary is less than $55,000\\nusing Excel, this is the command you would use:\\n=NORM.DIST(55000, 60000, 7500, TRUE)\\nResult: 0.25249\\nThus, there is a probability of about 25% that a random employee has a salary less than $55,000.\\nExponential Distribution\\nThe exponential distribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs. For\\nexample, a finance professional might want to model the time to default on payments for company debt\\nholders.\\nAn exponential distribution is one in which there are fewer large values and more small values. For example,\\nmarketing studies have shown that the amount of money customers spend in a store follows an exponential\\ndistribution. There are more people who spend small amounts of money and fewer people who spend large\\namounts of money.\\nExponential distributions are commonly used in calculations of product reliability, or the length of time a\\nproduct lasts.

For example, an investor approaching retirement age may wish to\\nshift assets in a portfolio to more conservative and lower-volatility investments. Weightings can be calculated\\nin several different ways—for example, based on individual stocks in a portfolio or on various sectors in a\\nportfolio. Weightings can also be calculated based on number of shares or the value of shares of a stock.\\nTo calculate a weighting in a portfolio based on value, take the value of the particular investment and divide it\\nby the total value of the overall portfolio. As an example, consider an individual’s retirement account for which\\nthe desired portfolio weighting is determined to be 40% stocks, 50% bonds, and 10% cash equivalents.

For\\nexample, we can assign a probability to the outcome of a certain stock increasing in value or decreasing in\\nvalue. One application of a probability distribution function is determining expected value.\\nIn many financial situations, we are interested in determining the expected value of the return on a particular\\ninvestment or the expected return on a portfolio of multiple investments. To calculate expected returns, we\\nformulate a probability distribution and then use the following formula to calculate expected value:\\nwhere P1, P2, P3, ⋯ Pn are the probabilities of the various returns and R1, R2, R3, ⋯ Rn are the various rates of\\nreturn.\\nIn essence, expected value is a weighted mean where the probabilities form the weights.

Univariate data refers to observations recorded for a single characteristic or attribute, such\\nas salaries or blood pressure measurements. When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among\\nseveral types of graphs, such as bar graphs, time series graphs, and so on.\\nThe most effective type of graph to use for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the data and the\\npurpose of the graph. For example, a time series graph is typically used to show how a measurement is\\nchanging over time and to identify patterns or trends over time.\\nBelow are some examples of typical applications for various graphs and displays.\\nGraphs used to show the distribution of data:\\n• Bar chart: used to show frequency or relative frequency distributions for categorical data\\n• Histogram: used to show frequency or relative frequency distributions for continuous data\\nGraphs used to show relationships between data points:\\n• Time series graph: used to show measurement data plotted against time, where time is displayed on the\\nhorizontal axis\\n• Scatter plot: used to show the relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable\\nBar Graphs\\nA bar graph consists of bars that are separated from each other and compare percentages.

One advantage of a histogram is that it can readily display large data sets. A rule of thumb\\nis to use a histogram when the data set consists of 100 values or more.\\nA histogram consists of contiguous (adjoining) boxes. It has both a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The\\nhorizontal axis is labeled with what the data represents (for instance, distance from your home to school). The\\nvertical axis is labeled either Frequency or Relative Frequency (or Percent Frequency or Probability). The graph\\nwill have the same shape regardless of the label on the vertical axis. A histogram, like a stem-and-leaf plot, can\\ngive you the shape of the data, the center, and the spread of the data.\\nThe relative frequency is equal to the frequency of an observed data value divided by the total number of data\\nvalues in the sample. Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times a solution occurs. Relative\\nfrequency is calculated using the formula\\nwhere f = frequency, n = the total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and RF =\\nrelative frequency.\\nTo construct a histogram, first decide how many bars or intervals, also called classes, will represent the data.\\nMany histograms consist of 5 to 15 bars or classes for clarity. The number of bars needs to be chosen. Choose\\na starting point for the first interval that is less than the smallest data value. A convenient starting point is a\\nlower value carried out to one more decimal place than the value with the most decimal places. For example, if\\nthe value with the most decimal places is 6.1, and if this is the smallest value, a convenient starting point is\\n6.05 (because ). We say that 6.05 has more precision. If the value with the most decimal\\nplaces is 2.23 and the lowest value is 1.5, a convenient starting point is 1.495 ( ). If the value\\nwith the most decimal places is 3.234 and the lowest value is 1.0, a convenient starting point is\\n. If all the data values happen to be integers and the smallest value is 2, then a\\nconvenient starting point is . Also, when the starting point and other boundaries are\\ncarried to one additional decimal place, no data value will fall on a boundary.

Rounding up to 2 is one way to prevent\\na value from falling on a boundary. Rounding to the next number is often necessary, even if it goes against the\\nstandard rules of rounding. For this example, using 1.76 as the width would also work. A guideline that is\\nfollowed by some for the width of a bar or class interval is to take the square root of the number of data values\\nand then round to the nearest whole number if necessary. For example, if there are 150 data values, take the\\nsquare root of 150 and round to 12 bars or intervals.

An example of paired data would be if data were collected on employees’ years of experience and\\ntheir corresponding salaries. Typically, it is of interest to investigate possible associations or correlations\\nbetween the two variables under analysis.\\nTime Series Graphs\\nSuppose that we want to track the consumer price index (CPI) over the past 10 years. One feature of the data\\nthat we may want to consider is the element of time. Because each year is paired with the CPI value for that\\nyear, we do not have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the years given to impose a\\nchronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing CPI value as\\nthe decade progresses is called a time series graph.\\nTo construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our paired data set. We start with a standard\\nCartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the time increments, and the vertical axis is\\nused to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph\\ncorrespond to a point in time and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by\\nstraight lines in the order in which they occur.\\nExample: The following data set shows the annual CPI for 10 years. We need to construct a time series graph\\nfor the (rounded) annual CPI data (see Table 13.12).

The\\nterms mean and average are often used interchangeably. To calculate the mean for a set of numbers, add the\\nnumbers together and then divide the sum by the number of data values. The geometric mean redistributes\\nnot the sum of the values but the product by multiplying all of the individual values and then redistributing\\nthem in equal portions such that the total product remains the same. To calculate the median for a set of\\nnumbers, order the data from smallest to largest and identify the middle data value in the ordered data set.\\n13.2 Measures of Spread\\nThe standard deviation and variance are measures of the spread of a data set. The standard deviation is small\\nwhen the data values are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard\\ndeviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation. The\\nformula used to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the data represents a sample or a\\npopulation, as the formulas for the sample standard deviation and the population standard deviation are\\nslightly different.\\n13.3 Measures of Position\\nSeveral measures are used to indicate the position of a data value in a data set. One measure of position is the\\nz-score for a particular measurement. The z-score indicates how many standard deviations a particular\\nmeasurement is above or below the mean. Other measures of position include quartiles and percentiles.\\nQuartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, Q1, is the same as the 25th percentile, and the third quartile,\\nQ3, is the same as the 75th percentile. The median, M, is called both the second quartile and the 50th\\npercentile. To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles\\ndivide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths.\\n13.4 Statistical Distributions\\nA frequency distribution provides a method of organizing and summarizing a data set and allows us to\\norganize and tabulate the data in a summarized way. Once a frequency distribution is generated, it can be\\nused to create graphs to help facilitate an interpretation of the data set. The normal distribution has two\\nparameters, or numerical descriptive measures: the mean, , and the standard deviation, . The exponential\\ndistribution is often concerned with the amount of time until some specific event occurs.\\n13.5 Probability Distributions\\nA probability distribution is a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to various outcomes. In many\\nfinancial situations, we are interested in determining the expected value of the return on a particular\\ninvestment or the expected return on a portfolio of multiple investments. When analyzing distributions that\\nfollow a normal distribution, probabilities can be calculated by finding the area under the graph of the normal\\ncurve.\\n13.6 Data Visualization and Graphical Displays\\nData visualization refers to the use of graphical displays to summarize a data set to help to interpret patterns\\nand trends in the data. Univariate data refers to observations recorded for a single characteristic or attribute,\\nsuch as salaries or blood pressure measurements. When graphing univariate data, we can choose from among\\nseveral types of graphs. The type of graph to be used for a certain data set will depend on the nature of the\\ndata and the purpose of the graph. Examples of graphs for univariate data include line graphs, bar graphs,\\nand histograms.

Correlation analysis allows the\\ndetermination of a statistical relationship between two numeric quantities. Regression analysis can be used to\\npredict one quantity based on a second quantity, assuming there is a significant correlation between the two\\nquantities. For example, in finance, we use regression analysis to calculate the beta coefficient of a stock,\\nwhich represents the volatility of the stock versus overall market volatility, with volatility being a measure of\\nrisk.\\nA business may want to establish a correlation between the amount the company spent on advertising versus\\nits recorded sales. If a strong enough correlation is established, then the business manager can predict sales\\nbased on the amount spent on advertising for a given time period.\\nFinance professionals often use correlation analysis to predict future trends and mitigate risk in a stock\\nportfolio. For example, if two investments are strongly correlated, an investor might not want to have both\\ninvestments in a certain portfolio since the two investments would tend to move in the same directions during\\nup markets or down markets. To diversify a portfolio, an investor might seek investments that are not strongly\\ncorrelated with one another.\\nRegression analysis can be used to establish a mathematical equation that relates a dependent variable (such\\nas sales) to an independent variable (such as advertising expenditure).

For example, we may be interested\\nto know if there is a correlation between bond prices and interest rates or between the age of a car and the\\nvalue of the car. To investigate the correlation between two numeric quantities, the first step is to create a\\nscatter plot that will graph the (x, y) ordered pairs. The independent, or explanatory, quantity is labeled as the\\nx-variable, and the dependent, or response, quantity is labeled as the y-variable.\\nFor example, we may be interested to know if the price of Nike stock is correlated with the value of the S&P 500\\n(Standard & Poor’s 500 stock market index). To investigate this, monthly data can be collected for Nike stock\\nprices and value of the S&P 500 for a period of time, and a scatter plot can be created and examined. A scatter\\nplot, or scatter diagram, is a graphical display intended to show the relationship between two variables. The\\nsetup of the scatter plot is that one variable is plotted on the horizontal axis and the other variable is plotted\\non the vertical axis. Each pair of data values is considered as an (x, y) point, and the various points are plotted\\non the diagram. A visual inspection of the plot is then made to detect any patterns or trends on the scatter\\ndiagram. Table 14.1 shows the relationship between the Nike stock price and its S&P value over a one-year\\ntime period.\\nTo assess linear correlation, the graphical trend of the data points is examined on the scatter plot to determine\\nif a straight-line pattern exists. If a linear pattern exists, the correlation may indicate either a positive or a\\nnegative correlation. A positive correlation indicates that as the independent variable increases, the dependent\\nvariable tends to increase as well, or, as the independent variable decreases, the dependent variable tends to\\ndecrease (the two quantities move in the same direction). A negative correlation indicates that as the\\nindependent variable increases, the dependent variable decreases, or, as the independent variable decreases,\\nthe dependent variable increases (the two quantities move in opposite directions). If there is no relationship or\\nassociation between the two quantities, where one quantity changing does not affect the other quantity, we\\nconclude that there is no correlation between the two variables.\\nDate S&P 500\\nNike\\nStock Price\\n4/1/2020 2,912.43 87.18\\n5/1/2020 3,044.31 98.58\\n6/1/2020 3,100.29 98.05\\nTable 14.1 Nike Stock Price ($) and\\nValue of S&P 500 over a One-Year\\nTime Period (source: Yahoo!

The sample data are used to compute r, the correlation coefficient for the sample. If we had data for the\\nentire population (that is, all measurements of interest), we could find the population correlation coefficient,\\nwhich is labeled as the Greek letter ρ (pronounced “rho”). But because we have only sample data, we cannot\\ncalculate the population correlation coefficient. The sample correlation coefficient, r, is our estimate of the\\nunknown population correlation coefficient.\\n• ρ = population correlation coefficient (unknown)\\n• r = sample correlation coefficient (known; calculated from sample data)\\nAn important step in the correlation analysis is to determine if the correlation is significant. By this, we are\\nasking if the correlation is strong enough to allow meaningful predictions for y based on values of x. One\\nmethod to test the significance of the correlation is to employ a hypothesis test. The hypothesis test lets us\\ndecide whether the value of the population correlation coefficient ρ is close to zero or significantly different\\nfrom zero. We decide this based on the sample correlation coefficient r and the sample size n.\\nIf the test concludes that the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, we say that the\\ncorrelation coefficient is significant.\\n• Conclusion: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between x\\nand y variables because the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero.\\n• What the conclusion means: There is a significant linear relationship between the x and y variables. If the\\ntest concludes that the correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero (it is close to zero), we\\nsay that the correlation coefficient is not significant.\\nA hypothesis test can be performed to test if the correlation is significant. A hypothesis test is a statistical\\nmethod that uses sample data to test a claim regarding the value of a population parameter. In this case, the\\nhypothesis test will be used to test the claim that the population correlation coefficient ρ is equal to zero.\\nUse these hypotheses when performing the hypothesis test:\\n• Null hypothesis:\\n• Alternate hypothesis:\\nThe hypotheses can be stated in words as follows:\\n• Null hypothesis : The population correlation coefficient is not significantly different from zero.

The value of this is obvious. Careful policy cannot be made\\nwithout estimates of the effects that may result. Indeed, it is the desire for particular results that drive the\\nformation of most policy. Regression models can be, and have been, invaluable aids in forming such policies.\\nRemember that point estimates do not carry a particular level of probability, or level of confidence, because\\npoints have no “width” above which there is an area to measure. There are actually two different approaches\\nto the issue of developing estimates of changes in the independent variable (or variables) on the dependent\\nvariable. The first approach wishes to measure the expected mean value of y from a specific change in the\\nvalue of x.\\nThe second approach to estimate the effect of a specific value of x on y treats the event as a single experiment:\\nyou choose x and multiply it times the coefficient, and that provides a single estimate of y. Because this\\napproach acts as if there were a single experiment, the variance that exists in the parameter estimate is larger\\nthan the variance associated with the expected value approach.\\nThe conclusion is that we have two different ways to predict the effect of values of the independent variable(s)\\non the dependent variable, and thus we have two different intervals. Both are correct answers to the question\\nbeing asked, but there are two different questions. To avoid confusion, the first case where we are asking for\\nthe expected value of the mean of the estimated y is called a confidence interval. The second case, where we\\nare asking for the estimate of the impact on the dependent variable y of a single experiment using a value of x,\\nis called the prediction interval.\\nThe prediction interval for an individual y for can be calculated as\\nwhere se is the standard deviation of the error term, sx is the standard deviation of the x-variable, and is\\nthe critical value of the t-distribution at the confidence level.\\nTabulated values of the t-distribution are available in online references such as the Engineering Statistics\\nHandbook (https://openstax.org/r/engineering_handbook). The mathematical computations for prediction\\nintervals are complex, and usually the calculations are performed using software. The formula above can be\\nimplemented in Excel to create a 95% prediction interval for the forecast for monthly revenue when\\nis spent on monthly advertising. Figure 14.10 shows the detailed calculations in Excel to arrive at a\\n95% prediction interval of (13,270.95, 15,370.09) for the monthly revenue.

Remember that\\nall regression equations go through the point of means—that is, the mean value of y and the mean values of\\nall independent variables in the equation. As the value of x gets further and further from the (x, y) point\\ncorresponding to the mean value of x and the mean value of y, the width of the estimated interval around the\\npoint estimate increases. Choosing values of x beyond the range of the data used to estimate the equation\\nposes an even greater danger of creating estimates with little use, very large intervals, and risk of error. Figure\\n14.12 shows this relationship.\\nFigure 14.12 Confidence Interval for an Individual Value of x, , at 95% Confidence Level\\nFigure 14.12 demonstrates the concern for the quality of the estimated interval, whether it is a prediction\\ninterval or a confidence interval. As the value chosen to predict y, in the graph, is further from the central\\nweight of the data, , we see the interval expand in width even while holding constant the level of confidence.\\nThis shows that the precision of any estimate will diminish as one tries to predict beyond the largest weight of\\nthe data and most certainly will degrade rapidly for predictions beyond the range of the data. Unfortunately,\\nthis is just where most predictions are desired. They can be made, but the width of the confidence interval may\\nbe so large as to render the prediction useless.\\n14.6 Use of R Statistical Analysis Tool for Regression Analysis\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Generate correlation coefficients using the R statistical tool.\\n• Generate linear regression models using the R statistical tool.\\nGenerate Correlation Coefficients Using the R Statistical Tool\\nR is an open-source statistical analysis tool that is widely used in the finance industry.

A correlation coefficient called r is\\nused to assess the strength and direction of the correlation. The value of r is always between and . The\\nsize of the correlation r indicates the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables. Values of r\\nclose to or to indicate a stronger linear relationship. A positive value of r means that when x increases, y\\ntends to increase and when x decreases, y tends to decrease (positive correlation). A negative value of r means\\nthat when x increases, y tends to decrease and when x decreases, y tends to increase (negative correlation).\\n14.2 Linear Regression Analysis\\nLinear regression analysis uses a straight-line fit to model the relationship between the two variables. Once a\\nstraight-line model is developed, this model can then be used to predict the value of the dependent variable\\nfor a specific value of the independent variable. Two parameters are calculated for the linear model, the slope\\nof the best-fit line and the y-intercept of the best-fit line. The method of least squares is used to generate\\nthese parameters; this method is based on minimizing the squared differences between the predicted values\\nand observed values for y.\\n14.3 Best-Fit Linear Model\\nOnce a correlation has been deemed significant, a linear regression model is developed. The goal in the\\nregression analysis is to determine the coefficients a and b in the following regression equation: .\\nTypically some technology, such as Excel, R statistical tool, or a calculator, is used to generate the coefficients a\\nand b since manual calculations are cumbersome.\\n14.4 Regression Applications in Finance\\nRegression analysis is used extensively in finance-related applications. Many typical applications involve\\ndetermining if there is a correlation between various stock market indices such as the S&P 500, the DJIA, and\\nthe Russell 2000 index. The procedure is to first generate a scatter plot to determine if a visual trend is\\nobserved, then calculate a correlation coefficient and check for significance. If the correlation coefficient is\\nsignificant, a linear model can then be generated and used for predictions.\\n14.5 Predictions and Prediction Intervals\\nA key aspect of generating the linear regression model is to then use the model for predictions, provided that\\nthe correlation is significant. To generate predictions or forecasts using the linear regression model, substitute\\nthe value of the independent variable (x) in the regression equation and solve the equation for the dependent\\nvariable (y). When making predictions using the linear model, it is generally recommended to only predict\\nvalues for y using values of x that are in the original range of the data collection.\\n14.6 Use of R Statistical Analysis Tool for Regression Analysis\\nR is an open-source statistical analysis tool that is widely used in the finance industry and can be found online\\n(https://openstax.org/r/finance_industry). R provides an integrated suite of functions for data analysis,\\ngraphing, and correlation and regression analysis.

Investors are interested in both risk and return\\nbecause understanding one without the other is really meaningless. In terms of investment, the concept of\\nreturn is fairly straightforward; return is the benefit, or profit, the investor expects from an expenditure. It is\\nthe reward for investing—the reason an investment is made in the first place. However, no investment is a\\nsure thing. The return may not be what the investor was expecting. This uncertainty about what the return will\\nbe is referred to as risk.\\nWe begin by looking at how to measure both risk and return when considering an individual asset, such as one\\nstock. If your grandparents bought 100 shares of Apple, Inc. stock for you when you were born, you are\\ninterested in knowing how well that investment has done. You may even want to compare how that\\ninvestment has fared to how an investment in a different stock, perhaps Disney, would have done. You are\\ninterested in measuring the historical return.\\nIndividual Investment Realized Return\\nThe realized return of an investment is the total return that occurs over a particular time period. Suppose that\\nyou purchased a share of Target (TGT) at the beginning of January 2020 for $128.74. At the end of the year, you\\nsold the stock for $176.53, which was $47.79 more than you paid for it. This increase in value is known as a\\ncapital gain. As the owner of the stock, you also received $2.68 in dividends during 2020. The total dollar return\\nfrom your investment is calculated as\\nIt is common to express investment returns in percentage terms rather than dollar terms. This allows you to\\nanswer the question “How much do I receive for each dollar invested?” so that you can compare investments\\nof different sizes. The total percent return from your investment is\\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the dividends you received by the initial stock price. This\\ncalculation says that for each dollar invested in TGT in 2020, you received $0.0208 in dividends. The capital\\ngain yield is the change in the stock price divided by the initial stock price. This calculation says that for each\\ndollar invested in TGT in 2020, you received $0.3712 in capital gains. Your total percent return of 39.20% means\\nthat you made $0.392 for every dollar invested when your gains from both dividends and stock price\\nappreciation are totaled together.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nCalculating Return\\nYou purchased 10 shares of 3M (MMM) stock in January 2020 for $175 per share, received dividends of $5.91\\n450 15 • How to Think about Investing\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Remember that if the\\nnormal distribution (a bell−shaped curve) describes returns, then 68% (or about two-thirds) of the time, the\\nreturn in a particular year will be within one standard deviation above and one standard deviation below the\\narithmetic average return. Given DAL’s average return of 22.4%, the actual yearly return will be somewhere\\nbetween −29.5% and 74.29% in two out of three years. A very high return of greater than 74.29% would occur\\n16% of the time; a very large loss of more than 29.5% would also occur 16% of the time.\\nAs you can see, there is a wide range of what can be considered a “typical” year for DAL. Although we can\\ncalculate an average return, the return in any particular year is likely to vary from that average. The larger the\\nstandard deviation, the greater this range of returns is. Thus, a larger standard deviation indicates a greater\\nvolatility of returns and, hence, more risk.\\nTHINK IT THROUGH\\nCalculating the Standard Deviation of Returns\\nYou calculated the arithmetic average return for CVS to be 11.11% for the 10-year period of 2011–2020.\\nCalculate the standard deviation of returns for CVS for the same period (see Table 15.5).

Finance)\\nStandard deviation is considered a measure of the risk of owning a stock. The larger the standard deviation of\\na stock’s annual returns, the further from the average that stock’s return is likely to be in any given year. In\\nother words, the return for the stock is highly unpredictable. Although the return for CVS varies from year to\\nyear, it is not subject to the wide swings of the returns for DAL or LUV.\\nWhy are stock returns so volatile? The value of the stock of a company changes as the expectations of the\\nfuture revenues and expenses of the company change. These expectations may change due to a number of\\nevents and new information. Good news about a company will tend to result in an increase in the stock price.\\nFor example, DAL announcing that it will be opening new routes and flying to cities it has not previously\\nserviced suggests that DAL will have more customers and more revenue in future years. Or if CVS announces\\nthat it has negotiated lower rent for many of its locations, investors will expect the expenses of the company to\\nfall, leading to more profits. Those types of announcements will often be associated with a higher stock price.\\nConversely, if the pilots and flight attendants for DAL negotiate higher salaries, the expenses for DAL will\\nincrease, putting downward pressure on profits and the stock price.\\n15.1 • Risk and Return to an Individual Asset 457', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Most investors, however, own\\nshares of stock in multiple companies. This collection of stocks is known as a portfolio. Let’s explore why it is\\nwise for investors to hold a portfolio of stocks rather than to pick just one favorite stock to own.\\nWe saw that investors who owned DAL experienced an average annual return of 20.87% but also a large\\nstandard deviation of 51.16%. Investors who used all their funds to purchase DAL stock did exceptionally well\\nduring 2012–2014. But in 2020, those investors lost almost one-third of their money as COVID-19 caused a\\nsharp reduction in air travel worldwide. To protect against these extreme outcomes, investors practice what is\\ncalled diversification, or owning a variety of stocks in their portfolios.\\nSuppose, for example, you have saved $50,000 that you want to invest. If you purchased $50,000 of DAL stock,\\nyou would not be diversified. Your return would depend solely on the return on DAL stock. If, instead, you used\\n$5,000 to purchase DAL stock and used the remaining $45,000 to purchase nine other stocks, you would be\\ndiversifying. Your return would depend not only on DAL’s return but also on the returns of the other nine\\nstocks in your portfolio. Investors practice diversification to manage risk.\\nIt is akin to the saying “Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket.” If you place all of your eggs in one basket\\nand that basket breaks, all of your eggs will fall and crack. If you spread your eggs out across a number of\\nbaskets, it is unlikely that all of the baskets will break and all of your eggs will crack. One basket may break,\\nand you will lose the eggs in that basket, but you will still have your other eggs. The same idea holds true for\\ninvesting. If you own stock in a company that does poorly, perhaps even goes out of business, you will lose the\\nmoney you placed in that particular investment. However, with a diversified portfolio, you do not lose all your\\nmoney because your money is spread out across a number of different companies.\\n1 Trefis Team and Great Speculations. “Is Peloton’s Tread+ Recall an Opportunity to Buy the Stock?” Forbes, May 7, 2021.\\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/05/07/is-pelotons-tread-recall-an-opportunity-to-buy-the-stock/\\n2 Tomi Kilgore. “Peloton Stock Sinks to 8-Month Low after 125,000 Treadmills Recalled for ‘Risk of Injury or Death.’” MarketWatch.\\nMay 6, 2021. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/peloton-stock-sinks-toward-9-month-low-after-125-000-treadmills-recalled-for-\\nrisk-of-injury-or-death-11620233715\\n458 15 • How to Think about Investing\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The\\nvolatility of individual assets becomes less and less important. As we discussed earlier, the risk that is\\nassociated with events related to a particular company is called firm-specific risk, or unsystematic, risk.\\nExamples of unsystematic risk would include a company facing a product liability lawsuit, a company inventing\\na new product, or accounting irregularities being detected. Holding a portfolio of stocks means that if one\\ncompany you have invested in goes out of business because of poor management, you do not lose all your\\nsavings because some of your money is invested in other companies. Portfolio diversification protects you\\nfrom being significantly impacted by unsystematic risk.\\nHowever, there is a level below which the portfolio risk does not drop, no matter how diversified the portfolio\\nbecomes. The risk that never goes away is known as systematic risk. Systematic risk is the risk of holding the\\nmarket portfolio.\\nWe have talked about reasons why a firm’s returns might be volatile; for example, the firm discovering a new\\ntechnology or having a product liability lawsuit brought against it will impact that firm specifically.

The systematic risk of a particular stock is\\nmeasured by how much the stock moves with the market. The measure of how much a stock moves with the\\nmarket is known as its beta. A stock that tends to move in sync with the market will have a beta of 1. For these\\nstocks, if the market goes up 10%, the stock generally also goes up 10%; if the market goes down 5%, stocks\\nwith a beta of 1 also tend to go down 5%.\\nIf a company has a beta greater than 1, then the stock tends to have a more pronounced move in the same\\ndirection as a market move. For example, if a stock has a beta of 2, the stock will tend to increase by 20% when\\nthe market goes up by 10%. If the market falls by 5%, that same stock will tend to fall by twice as much, or 10%.\\nThus, stocks with a beta greater than 1 experience greater swings than the overall market and are considered\\nto be riskier than the average stock.\\nOn the other hand, stocks with a beta less than 1 experience smaller swings than the overall market. A beta of\\n0.5, for example, means that a stock tends to experience moves that are only 50% of overall market moves. So,\\nif the market increases by 10%, a stock with a beta of 0.5 would tend to rise by only 5%. A market decline of 5%\\nwould tend to be associated with a 2.5% decrease in the stock.\\nCalculating Betas\\nThe calculation of beta for DAL is demonstrated in Figure 15.3. Monthly returns for DAL and for the S&P 500\\nare plotted in the diagram. Each dot in the scatter plot corresponds to a month from 2018 to 2020; for\\nexample, the dot that lies furthest in the upper right-hand corner represents November 2020. The return for\\nthe S&P 500 was 10.88% that month; this return is plotted along the horizontal axis. The return for DAL during\\nNovember 2020 was 31.36%; this return is plotted along the vertical axis.\\nYou can see that generally, when the overall stock market as measured by the S&P 500 is positive, the return\\nfor DAL is also positive. Likewise, in months in which the return for the S&P 500 is negative, the return for DAL\\nis also usually negative. Drawing a line that best fits the data, also known as a regression line, summarizes the\\nrelationship between the returns for DAL and the S&P 500. The slope of this line, 1.39, is DAL’s beta.

Two internet sources\\nthat can be used to find a company’s beta are Yahoo! Finance (https://openstax.org/r/finance.yahoo) and\\nMarketWatch (https://openstax.org/r/marketwatch_search). Various sources may not provide the exact\\nsame value for beta for a company. For example, in early February 2021, Yahoo! Finance reported that the\\nbeta for DAL was 1.46,8 while MarketWatch reported it as 1.29.9 Both of these numbers are slightly\\ndifferent from the 1.39 calculated in the graph above.\\nThere are several reasons why beta may vary slightly from source to source. One is the time frame used in\\nthe beta calculation. Data from three years were used to calculate the beta in Figure 15.3. Time frames\\nranging from three to five years are commonly used when calculating beta. Another reason different\\nsources might report different betas is the frequency with which the data is collected. Monthly returns are\\nused in Figure 15.3; some analysts will use weekly data. Finally, the S&P 500 is used to measure the market\\nreturn in Figure 15.3; the S&P 500 is one of the most common measures of overall market returns, but\\nalternatives exist and are used by some analysts\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nCAPM\\nWatch this video (https://openstax.org/r/pricing-model-capm) for further information about the CAPM.\\n8 “Delta Air Lines, Inc.

Suppose that you see an advertisement in which McKinley\\nInvestment Management claims that the portfolios of its clients have an average return of 20% per year. You\\nknow that this average annual return is meaningless without also knowing something about the riskiness of\\nthe firm’s strategy. In this section, we consider some ways to evaluate the riskiness of an investment strategy.\\nA basic measure of investment performance that includes an adjustment for risk is the Sharpe ratio. The\\nSharpe ratio is computed as a portfolio’s risk premium divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s\\nreturn, using the formula\\nThe portfolio risk premium is the portfolio return RP minus the risk-free return Rf; this is the basic reward for\\nbearing risk. If the risk-free return is 3%, McKinley Investment Management’s clients who are earning 20% on\\ntheir portfolios have an excess return of 17%.\\nThe standard deviation of the portfolio’s return, , is a measure of risk. Although you see that McKinley’s\\nclients earn a nice 20% return on average, you find that the returns are highly volatile. In some years, the\\nclients earn much more than 20%, and in other years, the return is much lower, even negative. That volatility\\nleads to a standard deviation of returns of 26%. The Sharpe ratio would be , or 0.65.\\nThus, the Sharpe ratio can be thought of as a reward-to-risk ratio. The standard deviation in the denominator\\ncan be thought of as the units of risk the investor has. The numerator is the reward the investor is receiving for\\ntaking on that risk.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nSharpe Ratio\\nThe Sharpe ratio was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe. You can visit Sharpe’s Stanford\\nUniversity website (https://openstax.org/r/stanford_wfsharpe) to find videos in which he discusses financial\\ntopics and links to his research as well as his advice on how to invest.\\nTreynor Measurement of Performance\\nAnother reward-to-risk ratio measurement of investment performance is the Treynor ratio. The Treynor ratio\\nis calculated as\\nJust as with the Sharpe ratio, the numerator of the Treynor ratio is a portfolio’s risk premium; the difference is\\nthat the Treynor ratio focus focuses on systematic risk, using the beta of the portfolio in the denominator,\\nwhile the Shape ratio focuses on total risk, using the standard deviation of the portfolio’s returns in the\\n15.4 • Applications in Performance Measurement 465', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

SPY is an ETF that was created to mimic the performance of the S&P 500 index by State Street Global\\nAdvisors and is often used as a proxy for the overall market performance.

In finance, risk is considered the volatility of the return from time period to\\ntime period. Historical returns are measured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the\\nstandard deviation of returns.\\n15.2 Risk and Return to Multiple Assets\\nAs investors hold multiple assets in a portfolio, they are able to eliminate firm-specific risk. However,\\nsystematic or market risk remains, even if an investor holds the market portfolio. The return to a portfolio is\\nmeasured by the arithmetic average, and the risk is measured by the standard deviation of the returns of the\\nportfolio. The risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average of the risk of the individual\\nsecurities because the returns of the securities are not perfectly correlated. A low or negative return for one\\nstock in a period can be offset by a high return for another stock in the same period.\\n15.3 The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) relates the expected return of an asset to the systematic risk of that\\nasset. Investors will be rewarded for taking on systematic risk. They will not be rewarded for taking on firm-\\nspecific risk, however, because that risk can be diversified away.\\n15.4 Applications in Performance Measurement\\nBecause investors are not simply interested in returns but are also interested in risk, the success of a portfolio\\ncannot be measured simply by considering the portfolio’s return. In order to compare investment portfolios,\\nrisk and return must both be taken into consideration. The Sharpe ratio and the Treynor ratio are two\\nmeasures that provide a reward-to-risk measure of a portfolio. Jensen’s alpha provides a measure of the\\nabnormal return of a portfolio, considering the portfolio’s risk level.\\n15.5 Using Excel to Make Investment Decisions\\nUsing Excel to manipulate publicly available stock data makes calculating the average return of a stock and the\\nstandard deviation of returns easy. The average return for a portfolio and the standard deviation of the\\nportfolio returns can also be calculated easily. By comparing the returns of a stock with the returns of the\\noverall market using Excel charting tools, the beta for a stock, which measures systematic risk, can be\\ndetermined.\\nKey Terms\\narithmetic average return the sum of an asset’s annual returns over a number of years divided by the\\nnumber of years\\nbeta a measure of how a stock moves relative to the market\\ncapital asset pricing model (CAPM) the expected return of a security, equal to the risk-free rate plus a\\npremium for the amount of risk taken\\ncapital gain yield the difference between the price a stock is sold for and the price that was originally paid\\nfor it divided by the price originally paid\\ndiversification holding a variety of assets in a portfolio\\ndividend yield the total dividends received by the owner of a share of stock divided by the price originally\\npaid for the stock\\neffective annual rate (EAR) returns expressed on an annualized or yearly basis; allows for the comparison\\nof various investments\\nfirm-specific risk the risk that an event may impact the expected revenue or costs of a firm, thereby\\n472 15 • Summary\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Should a bakery purchase tables\\nand chairs to provide places for customers to eat? Should a pharmaceutical company spend money on\\nresearch for a new vaccine? All of these questions involve spending money today to make money in the future.\\nThe process of making these decisions is often referred to as capital budgeting. In order to grow and remain\\ncompetitive, a firm relies on developing new products, improving existing products, and entering new\\nmarkets. These new ventures require investments in fixed assets. The company must decide whether the\\nproject will generate enough cash to cover the costs of these initial expenditures once the project is up and\\nrunning.\\nFor example, Sam’s Sporting Goods sells sporting equipment and uniforms to players on local recreational and\\nschool teams. Customers have been inquiring about customizing items such as baseball caps and equipment\\nbags with logos and other designs. Sam’s is considering purchasing an embroidery machine so that it can\\nprovide these customized items in-house. The machine will cost $16,000. Purchasing the embroidery machine\\nwould be an investment in a fixed asset.

The payback period calculation focuses on how\\nlong it will take for a company to make enough free cash flow from the investment to recover the initial cost of\\nthe investment.\\nPayback Period Calculation\\nIn order to purchase the embroidery machine, Sam’s Sporting Goods must spend $16,000. During the first\\nyear, Sam’s expects to see a $2,000 benefit from purchasing the machine, but this means that after one year,\\nthe company will have spent $14,000 more than it has made from the project. During the second year that it\\nuses the machine, Sam’s expects that its cash inflow will be $4,000 greater than it would have been if it had not\\nhad the machine. Thus, after two years, the company will have spent $10,000 more than it has benefited from\\nthe machine. This process is continued year after year until the accumulated increase in cash flow is $16,000,\\nor equal to the original investment. The process is summarized in Table 16.1.\\nYear 0 1 2 3 4 5\\nInitial Investment ($) (16,000)\\nCash Inflow ($) - 2,000 4,000 5,000 5,000 5,000\\nAccumulated Inflow ($) - 2,000 6,000 11,000 16,000 21,000\\nBalance ($) (16,000) (14,000) (10,000) (5,000) - 5,000\\nTable 16.1\\nSam’s Sporting Goods is expecting its cash inflow to increase by $16,000 over the first four years of using the\\nembroidery machine. Thus, the payback period for the embroidery machine is four years. In other words, it\\ntakes four years to accumulate $16,000 in cash inflow from the embroidery machine and recover the cost of\\nthe machine.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nCalculating the Payback Period\\nIt is possible that a project will not fully recover the initial cost in one year but will have more than\\nrecovered its initial cost by the following year.

This video demonstrates how to calculate the payback period\\n(https://openstax.org/r/how-to-calculate) in such a situation.\\nAdvantages\\nThe principal advantage of the payback period method is its simplicity. It can be calculated quickly and easily.\\nIt is easy for managers who have little finance training to understand. The payback measure provides\\ninformation about how long funds will be tied up in a project. The shorter the payback period of a project, the\\ngreater the project’s liquidity.\\nDisadvantages\\nAlthough it is simple to calculate, the payback period method has several shortcomings. First, the payback\\nperiod calculation ignores the time value of money. Suppose that in addition to the embroidery machine,\\nSam’s is considering several other projects. The cash flows from these projects are shown in Table 16.2. Both\\nProject B and Project C have a payback period of five years. For both of these projects, Sam’s estimates that it\\nwill take five years for cash inflows to add up to $16,000. The payback period method does not differentiate\\nbetween these two projects.\\nYear 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\\nProject A ($) (16,000) 2,000 4,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000\\nProject B ($) (16,000) 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 6,000 -\\nProject C ($) (16,000) 6,000 4,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 -\\nProject D ($) (16,000) 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 6,000 8,000\\nTable 16.2\\nHowever, we know that money has a time value, and receiving $6,000 in year 1 (as occurs in Project C) is\\npreferable to receiving $6,000 in year 5 (as in Projects B and D). From what we learned about the time value of\\nmoney, Projects B and C are not identical projects. The payback period method breaks the important finance\\nrule of not adding or comparing cash flows that occur in different time periods.\\nA second disadvantage of using the payback period method is that there is not a clearly defined acceptance or\\nrejection criterion. When the payback period method is used, a company will set a length of time in which a\\nproject must recover the initial investment for the project to be accepted. Projects with longer payback periods\\nthan the length of time the company has chosen will be rejected. If Sam’s were to set a payback period of four\\nyears, Project A would be accepted, but Projects B, C, and D have payback periods of five years and so would\\nbe rejected. Sam’s choice of a payback period of four years would be arbitrary; it is not grounded in any\\nfinancial reasoning or theory. No argument exists for a company to use a payback period of three, four, five, or\\nany other number of years as its criterion for accepting projects.\\nA third drawback of this method is that cash flows after the payback period are ignored. Projects B, C, and D all\\nhave payback periods of five years. However, Projects B and C end after year 5, while Project D has a large cash\\nflow that occurs in year 6, which is excluded from the analysis. The payback method is shortsighted in that it\\nfavors projects that generate cash flows quickly while possibly rejecting projects that create much larger cash\\nflows after the arbitrary payback time criterion.\\nFourth, no risk adjustment is made for uncertain cash flows. No matter how careful the planning and analysis,\\na business is seldom sure what future cash flows will be. Some projects are riskier than others, with less\\ncertain cash flows, but the payback period method treats high-risk cash flows the same way as low-risk cash\\nflows.\\n16.1 • Payback Period Method 481', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

What adjustments would students need to make to this analysis if they wanted to consider\\nattending a part-time MBA program that allowed them to continue working while completing the program?\\nNPV Profile\\nThe NPV of a project depends on the expected cash flows from the project and the discount rate used to\\ntranslate those expected cash flows to the present value. When we used a 9% discount rate, the NPV of the\\nembroidery machine project was $2,836. If a higher discount rate is used, the present value of future cash\\nflows falls, and the NPV of the project falls.\\nTheoretically, we should use the firm’s cost to attract capital as the discount rate when calculating NPV. In\\nreality, it is difficult to estimate this cost of capital accurately and confidently. Because the discount rate is an\\napproximate value, we want to determine whether a small error in our estimate is important to our overall\\nconclusion. We can do this by creating an NPV profile, which graphs the NPV at a variety of discount rates and\\nallows us to determine how sensitive the NPV is to changes in the discount rate.\\nTo construct an NPV profile for Sam’s, select several discount rates and compute the NPV for the embroidery\\nmachine project using each of those discount rates. Table 16.6 below shows the NPV for several discount rates.\\nNotice that if the discount rate is zero, the NPV is simply the sum of the cash flows. As the discount rate\\nbecomes larger, the NPV falls and eventually becomes negative.\\nThe information in Table 16.6 is presented in a graph in Figure 16.2. We can see that the graph crosses the\\nhorizontal axis at about 14%. To the left, or at lower discount rates, the NPV is positive.

In considering whether Sam’s Sporting Goods should purchase the\\nembroidery machine, the IRR method approaches the time value of money problem from a slightly different\\nangle. Instead of using the company’s cost of attracting funds for the discount rate and solving for NPV, as we\\ndid in the first NPV equation, we set NPV equal to zero and solve for the discount rate to find the IRR:\\nThe IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV profile graph crosses the horizontal axis. If the IRR is greater\\nthan the cost of capital, a project should be accepted. If the IRR is less than the cost of capital, a project should\\nbe rejected. The NPV profile graph for the embroidery machine crossed the horizontal axis at 14%. Therefore,\\nif Sam’s Sporting Goods can attract capital for less than 14%, the IRR exceeds the cost of capital and the\\nembroidery machine should be purchased. However, if it costs Sam’s more than 14% to attract capital, the\\nembroidery machine should not be purchased.\\nIn other words, a company wants to accept projects that have an IRR that exceed the company’s cost of\\nattracting funds. The cash flow from these projects will be great enough to cover the cost of attracting money\\nfrom investors in addition to the other costs of the project. A company should reject any project that has an\\nIRR less than the company’s cost of attracting funds; the cash flows from such a project are not enough to\\ncompensate the investors for the use of their funds.\\nCalculating IRR without a financial calculator is an arduous, time-consuming process that requires trial and\\nerror to find the discount rate that makes NPV exactly equal zero. Your calculator uses the same type of trial-\\nand-error iterative process, but because it uses an automated process, it can do so much more quickly than\\nyou can. A problem that might require 30 minutes of detailed mathematical calculations by hand can be\\n486 16 • How Companies Think about Investing\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

To calculate IRR, begin by entering the cash flows for the project, just as you do for the NPV\\ncalculation (see Table 16.7). After these cash flows are entered, simply compute IRR in the final step.\\nStep Description Enter Display\\n1 Select cash flow worksheet CFCF CF0 XXXX\\n2 Clear the cash flow worksheet 2ND2ND[CLR WORK] CF0 0\\n3 Enter initial cash flow 16000 +/-+/-ENTERENTER CF0 = -16,000.00\\n4 Enter cash flow for the first year ↓ 2000 ENTERENTER C01 = 2,000.00\\n↓ F01 = 1.0\\n5 Enter cash flow for the second year ↓ 4000 ENTERENTER C02 = 4,000.00\\n↓ F02 = 1.0\\n6 Enter cash flow for the third year ↓ 5000 ENTERENTER C03 = 5,000.00\\n↓ F03 = 1.0\\n7 Enter cash flow for the fourth year ↓ 5000 ENTERENTER C04 = 5,000.00\\n↓ F04 = 1.0\\n8 Enter cash flow for the fifth year ↓ 5000 ENTERENTER C05 = 5,000.00\\n↓ F05 = 1.0\\n9 Enter cash flow for the sixth year ↓ 5000 ENTERENTER C06 = 5,000.00\\n↓ F06 = 1.0\\n10 Compute IRR IRRIRRCPTCPT IRR = 14.09\\nTable 16.7 Calculator Steps for IRR\\nAdvantages\\nThe primary advantage of using the IRR method is that it is easy to interpret and explain. Investors like to\\nspeak in terms of annual percentage returns when evaluating investment possibilities.\\nDisadvantages\\nOne disadvantage of using IRR is that it can be tedious to calculate. We knew the IRR was about 14% for the\\nembroidery machine project because we had previously calculated the NPV for several discount rates. The IRR\\nis about, but not exactly, 14%, because NPV is not exactly equal to zero (just very close to zero) when we use\\n14% as the discount rate. Before the prevalence of financial calculators and spreadsheets, calculating the exact\\nIRR was difficult and time-consuming. With today’s technology, this is no longer a major consideration. Later\\nin this chapter, we will look at how to use a spreadsheet to do these calculations.\\nNo Single Mathematical Solution. Another disadvantage of using the IRR method is that there may not be a\\nsingle mathematical solution to an IRR problem. This can happen when negative cash flows occur in more than\\none period in the project. Suppose your company is considering building a facility for an upcoming Olympic\\ncompetition. The construction cost would be $350 million. The facility would be used for one year and generate\\ncash inflows of $950 million. Then, the following year, your company would be required to convert the facility\\ninto a public park area for the city, which is expected to cost $620 million. Placing these cash flows in a timeline\\nresults in the following (Table 16.8):\\n16.3 • Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method 487', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Because\\nthe NPV profile line crosses the horizontal axis twice, there are two IRRs. In other words, there are two interest\\nrates at which NPV equals zero.\\nFigure 16.3 NPV Profile Graph for a Project with Two IRRs\\nReinvestment Rate Assumption. The IRR assumes that the cash flows are reinvested at the internal rate of\\nreturn when they are received. This is a disadvantage of the IRR method. The firm may not be able to find any\\nother projects with returns equal to a high-IRR project, so the company may not be able to reinvest at the IRR.\\nThe reinvestment rate assumption becomes problematic when a company has several acceptable projects and\\nis attempting to rank the projects. We will look more closely at the issues that can arise when considering\\nmutually exclusive projects later in this chapter. If a company is simply deciding whether to accept a single\\nproject, the reinvestment assumption limitation is not relevant.\\nOverlooking Differences in Scale. Another disadvantage of using the IRR method to choose among various\\nacceptable projects is that it ignores differences in scale. The IRR converts the cash flows to percentages and\\nignores differences in the size or scale of projects. Issues that occur when comparing projects of different\\nscales are covered later in this chapter.\\n16.4 Alternative Methods\\nLearning Outcomes\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Calculate profitability index.\\n• Calculate discounted payback period.\\n• Calculate modified internal rate of return.\\nProfitability Index (PI)\\nThe profitability index (PI) uses the same inputs as the NPV calculation, but it converts the results to a ratio.\\nThe numerator is the present value of the benefits of doing a project.

When NPV is greater than zero, PI will be greater than 1. When\\nNPV is less than zero, PI will be less than 1. Therefore, the decision criterion using the PI method is to accept a\\nproject if the PI is greater than 1 and reject a project if the PI is less than 1.\\nNote that the NPV method and the PI method of project evaluation will always provide the same answer to the\\naccept-or-reject question. The advantage of using the PI method is that it is helpful in ranking projects from\\nbest to worst. Issues that arise when ranking projects are discussed later in this chapter.\\nDiscounted Payback Period\\nThe payback period method provides a fast, simple approach to evaluating a project, but it suffers from the\\nfact that it ignores the time value of money. The discounted payback period method addresses this flaw by\\ndiscounting cash flows using the company’s cost of funds and then using these discounted values to\\ndetermine the payback period.\\nConsider Sam’s Sporting Goods’ decision regarding whether to purchase an embroidery machine. The\\nexpected cash flows and their values when discounted using the company’s 9% cost of funds are shown in\\nTable 16.9. Earlier, we calculated the project’s payback period as four years; that is how long it would take the\\ncompany to recover all of the cash that it would spend on the project. Remember, however, that the payback\\nperiod does not consider the company’s cost of funds, so it underestimates the true breakeven time period.\\nYear 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\\nCash Flow ($) (16,000.00) 2,000.00 4,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00 5,000.00\\nDiscounted Cash Flow ($) (16,000) 1,834.86 3,366.72 3,860.92 3,542.13 3,249.66 2,981.34\\nCumulative Discounted\\nCash Flow ($) (16,000.00) (14,165.14) (10,798.42) (6,937.50) (3,395.37) (145.72) 2,835.62\\nTable 16.9\\nWhen the cash flows are appropriately discounted, the project still has not broken even by the end of year 5.\\nThe discounted payback period would be years. This adjusted calculation addresses the\\npayback period method’s flaw of not considering the time value of money, but managers are still confronted\\nwith the other disadvantages. No objective criterion for acceptance or rejection exists because of the lack of a\\ntheoretical underpinning for what is an acceptable payback period length. The discounted payback period\\nignores any cash flows after breakeven occurs; this is a serious drawback, especially when comparing mutually\\nexclusive projects.\\nModified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)\\nFinancial analysts have developed an alternative evaluation technique that is similar to the IRR but modified in\\nan attempt to address some of the weakness of the IRR method. This modified internal rate of return\\n(MIRR) is calculated using the following steps:\\n1.

This method can become tedious when the length of the longer project is not a multiple\\nof the shorter project. For example, when choosing between a five-year project and a seven-year project, the\\nshort one would have to be duplicated seven times and the long project would have to be repeated five times\\nto get to a common length of 35 years for the two projects.\\nEqual Annuity Approach\\nThe equal annuity approach assumes that both the short-term and the long-term projects can be repeated\\nforever. This approach involves the following steps:\\nStep 1: Find the NPV of each of the projects.\\n• The NPV of the larger, older ice-cream truck is $49,474.\\n• The NPV of the smaller, newer ice-cream truck is $80,658.\\nStep 2: Find the annuity that has the same present value as the NPV and the same number of periods as the\\nproject.\\n• For the larger, older ice-cream truck, we want to find the three-year annuity that would have a present\\nvalue of $49,474 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $19,894.\\n• For the smaller, newer ice-cream truck, we want to find the six-year annuity that would have a present\\nvalue of $80,658 when using a 10% discount rate. This is $18,520.\\nStep 3: Assume that these projects, or similar projects, can be repeated over and over and that these annuities\\nwill continue forever. Calculate the present value of these annuities continuing forever using the perpetuity\\nformula.\\nWe again find that the older, larger truck is preferred to the newer, smaller truck.\\nThese methods correct for unequal lives, but managers need to be aware that some unavoidable issues come\\nup when these adjustments are made. Both the replacement chain and equal annuity approaches assume that\\nprojects can be replicated with identical projects in the future. It is important to note that this is not always a\\nreasonable assumption; these replacement projects may not exist. Estimating cash flows from potential\\nprojects is prone to errors, as we will discuss in Financial Forecasting these errors are compounded and\\nbecome more significant as projects are expected to be repeated. Inflation and changing market conditions\\nare likely to result in cash flows varying in the future from our predictions, and as we go further into the\\nfuture, these changes are potentially greater.\\nChoosing Projects When Resources Are Limited\\nChoosing positive NPV projects adds value to a company. Although we often assume that the company will\\nchoose to pursue all positive NPV projects, in reality, managers often face a budget that restricts the amount\\nof capital that they may invest in a given time period. Thus, managers are forced to choose among several\\npositive NPV projects. The goal is to maximize the total NPV of the firm’s projects while remaining within\\nbudget constraints.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nProfitability Index\\nManagers should reject any project with a negative NPV.

The goal of capital budgeting is to choose the projects that will\\nbring the most value to the shareholders of the company. The NPV rule provides a clear, concise criterion\\nfor which projects will bring value to the shareholders. It is important to remember, however, that all of the\\nproject valuation calculations are based on projected cash flows. These projected cash flows are estimates,\\nbased on the best educated guesses that a company makes about its business opportunities over the next\\nfew years. Because no company has a crystal ball that can predict the future, its calculation of NPV is an\\nestimate of what it expects.\\nThink, for example, of an oil company deciding whether to drill for oil. The project will require expenditures\\non equipment, land, and other items. The cash inflows will depend on the likelihood of oil being found, the\\nquantity of oil produced by the well, and the price at which the oil can be sold. If a company estimates that\\noil will sell for $100 per barrel during the next few years, the project will have a much higher NPV than if the\\ncompany estimates that oil will sell for only $50 per barrel.\\nA project that has a positive NPV and is accepted when a company is planning how to allocate its capital\\ntoward investments may end up being a bad project that the company wishes it had avoided if the future is\\nmuch different from what it projected. Managers must stay attuned to economic developments and\\nreevaluate capital budgeting decisions when significant changes occur. In spring 2020, managers around\\nthe globe were faced with a dramatically changing economic environment amid a pandemic. Oil companies,\\nfor example, saw oil prices drop from over $50 per barrel at the beginning of March to under $15 per barrel\\nby the end of April.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nReducing Capital Spending\\nIn June 2020, McKinsey & Company looked at major companies around the world that were reducing their\\ncapital expenditures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. These companies were cutting their capital\\nbudgets by 10% to 80% from their originally planned levels for 2020. Reductions were especially large in the\\noil and gas industry, as companies found their revenue projections, and thus the NPV of their planned\\nprojects, falling dramatically. In addition, companies found themselves needing to free up cash; with more\\nlimited cash resources, fewer positive NPV projects could be accepted and funded.3 Due to the COVID-19\\npandemic, many CFOs were challenged to stabilize their corporate cash flows. This article explains how\\nquickly reducing capital spending (https://openstax.org/r/quickly-reducing), which is usually a quick\\nenough fix, was able to help.\\n3 Tom Brinded, Zak Cutler, Erikhans Kok, and Prakash Parbhoo. “Resetting Capital Spending in the Wake of COVID-19.” McKinsey &\\nCompany.

An advantage of using Excel is that you can quickly change any\\nassumptions or numbers in your problem and recalculate NPV or IRR based on that updated information.\\nExcel is a versatile tool with more than one way to set up most problems. We will consider a couple of\\nstraightforward examples of using Excel to calculate NPV and IRR.\\nSuppose your company is considering a project that will cost $30,000 this year. The cash inflow from this\\nproject is expected to be $6,000 next year and $8,000 the following year. The cash inflow is expected to\\nincrease by $2,000 yearly, resulting in a cash inflow of $18,000 in year 7, the final year of the project. You know\\nthat your company’s cost of funds is 9%. Your company would like to evaluate this project.\\nCalculating NPV Using Excel\\nTo calculate NPV using Excel, you would begin by placing each year’s expected cash flows in a sheet, as in row\\n5 in Figure 16.4. One approach to calculating NPV is to use the formula for discounting future cash flows, as is\\nshown in row 6.\\nFigure 16.4 Inserting Present Cash Flows Using Excel ($ except Cost of Funds)\\nFigure 16.5 shows the present value of each year’s cash flow resulting from the formula.

The NPV formula is\\nshown in cell J7 in Figure 16.6 below. However, it is important to pay attention to how Excel defines NPV. The\\nExcel NPV function calculates the sum of the present values of the cash flows occurring from period 1 through\\nthe end of the project using the designated discount rate, but it fails to include the initial investment at time\\n496 16 • How Companies Think about Investing\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

This function is shown in Figure 16.7, cell J8. The IRR function\\nproperly uses all the project’s cash flows, including the initial cash outflow at time 0, in its calculation, unlike\\nthe NPV function. This function will correctly return the IRR of 27.7% for the project.

Also, the cost of attracting capital can change with economic and market conditions.\\nEspecially if markets are volatile, a company may use an NPV profile to see how sensitive their decisions are to\\nchanges in financing costs.

Its usefulness is limited, however, because it ignores the time value of money.\\n16.2 Net Present Value (NPV) Method\\nNet present value (NPV) is calculated by subtracting the present value of a project’s cash outflows from the\\npresent value of the project’s cash inflows. A project should be accepted if its NPV is positive and rejected if its\\nNPV is negative.\\n16.3 Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Method\\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) of a project is the discount rate that sets the present value of a project’s cash\\ninflows exactly equal to the present value of the project’s cash outflows. A project should be accepted if its IRR\\nis greater than the firm’s cost of attracting capital.\\n16.4 Alternative Methods\\nThe discounted payback period uses the time value of money to discount future cash flows to see how long it\\nwill be before the initial investment of a project is recovered. MIRR provides a variation on IRR in which all cash\\nflows are compounded using the cost of capital, resolving the reinvestment rate assumption problem of the\\nIRR method; unlike IRR, which may have multiple mathematical solutions, MIRR will result in one solution. The\\nprofitability index is calculated as the NPV of the project divided by the initial cost of the project.\\n16.5 Choosing between Projects\\nFirms may need to choose among a variety of good projects. The projects may have different lives or be\\ndifferently sized projects that require different amounts of resources. By choosing projects with the highest\\nprofitability index, companies can take on the projects that will lead to the greatest increase in value for the\\ncompany.\\n16.6 Using Excel to Make Company Investment Decisions\\nExcel spreadsheets provide a way to easily calculate the NPV and IRR of a project. Using Excel to create an NPV\\nprofile allows a company to see how much its estimates of the cost of raising funds can err from the true cost\\nand have the project still be an acceptable project.\\nKey Terms\\ncapital budgeting the process a business follows to evaluate potential major projects or investments\\ndiscounted payback period the length of time it will take for the present value of the future cash inflows of\\na project to equal the initial cost of the investment\\nequal annuity approach a method of comparing projects of different lives by assuming that the projects can\\nbe repeated forever\\ninternal rate of return (IRR) the discount rate that sets the NPV of a project equal to zero\\nmodified internal rate of return (MIRR) the yield that sets the future value of the cash inflows of a project\\nequal to the present value of the cash outflows of the project\\nmutually exclusive projects projects that compete against each other so that when one project is chosen,\\nthe other project cannot be done\\nnet present value (NPV) the present value of the cash inflows of a project minus the present value of the\\ncash outflows of the project\\npayback period the length of time it will take for a company to make enough money from an investment to\\nrecover the initial cost of the investment\\n16 • Summary 501', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Some obvious\\nthings come to mind when you think of how managers would do this. For example, to maximize the value of\\nAmerican Airlines, the managers need to attract customers and sell seats on flights. They also need to keep\\ncosts as low as possible, which means keeping the costs of purchasing fuel and making plane repairs as low as\\npossible. While the concept of keeping costs low is simple, the specific decisions a firm makes can be complex.\\nIf American Airlines wants to purchase a new airplane, it needs to consider not just the dollar cost of the initial\\npurchase but also the passenger and cargo capacity of the plane as well as ongoing maintenance costs.\\nIn addition to paying salaries to its pilots and flight attendants, American Airlines must pay to use investors’\\nmoney. If the company wants to purchase a new airplane, it may borrow money to pay for the plane. Even if\\nAmerican Airlines does not need to incur debt to buy the plane, the money it uses to buy the plane ultimately\\nbelongs to the owners or shareholders of the company. The company must consider the opportunity cost of\\nthis money and the return that shareholders are expecting on their investments.\\nJust as different planes have distinctive characteristics and costs, the different types of financing that American\\nAirlines can use will have different characteristics and costs. One of the tasks of the financial manager is to\\nconsider the trade-offs of these sources of funding. In this chapter, we look at the basic principles that\\nmanagers use to minimize the cost of funding and maximize the value of the firm.\\nHow Firms Raise Capital\\n17\\n17 • Why It Matters 507', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

If a firm will produce shirts, for\\nexample, it will need equipment such as sewing machines, cutting boards, irons, and a building in which to\\nstore its equipment. The company will also need some raw materials such as fabric, buttons, and thread. These\\nitems the company needs to conduct its operations are assets. They appear on the left-hand side of the\\nbalance sheet.\\nThe company has to pay for these assets. The sources of the money the company uses to pay for these assets\\nappear on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. The company’s sources of financing represent its capital.\\nThere are two broad types of capital: debt (or borrowing) and equity (or ownership).\\nFigure 17.2 is a representation of a basic balance sheet. Remember that the two sides of the balance sheet\\nmust be . Companies typically finance their assets through equity (selling\\nownership shares to stockholders) and debt (borrowing money from lenders). The debt that a firm uses is\\noften referred to as financial leverage. The relative proportions of debt and equity that a firm uses in\\nfinancing its assets is referred to as its capital structure.\\nFigure 17.2 Basic Balance Sheet for Company with Debt, Preferred Stock, and Common Equity in Capital Structure\\nAttracting Capital\\nWhen a company raises money from investors, those investors forgo the opportunity to invest that money\\nelsewhere. In economics terms, there is an opportunity cost to those who buy a company’s bonds or stock.\\nSuppose, for example, that you have $5,000, and you purchase Tesla stock. You could have purchased Apple\\nstock or Disney stock instead. There were many other options, but once you chose Tesla stock, you no longer\\nhad the money available for the other options. You would only purchase Tesla stock if you thought that you\\nwould receive a return as large as you would have for the same level of risk on the other investments.\\nFrom Tesla’s perspective, this means that the company can only attract your capital if it offers an expected\\nreturn high enough for you to choose it as the company that will use your money. Providing a return equal to\\nwhat potential investors could expect to earn elsewhere for a similar risk is the cost a company bears in\\nexchange for obtaining funds from investors. Just as a firm must consider the costs of electricity, raw\\nmaterials, and wages when it calculates the costs of doing business, it must also consider the cost of attracting\\ncapital so that it can purchase its assets.\\nWeights in the Capital Structure\\nMost companies have multiple sources of capital. The firm’s overall cost of capital is a weighted average of its\\n508 17 • How Firms Raise Capital\\nAccess for free at openstax.org', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The average of a firm’s debt and equity costs of capital, weighted by the\\nfractions of the firm’s value that correspond to debt and equity, is known as the weighted average cost of\\ncapital (WACC).\\nThe weights in the WACC are the proportions of debt and equity used in the firm’s capital structure. If, for\\nexample, a company is financed 25% by debt and 75% by equity, the weights in the WACC would be 25% on the\\ndebt cost of capital and 75% on the equity cost of capital.

However, issues come up when financial managers\\ncalculate WACC in practice. Both the weights of the equity components and the cost of the equity components\\nare needed to calculate the WACC. The WACC that financial managers derive will depend on the assumptions\\nand models they use to determine what weights and capital costs to use.\\nIssues in Estimating the Cost of Equity Capital\\nWe have explored two ways of estimating the cost of equity capital: the CAPM and the constant dividend\\ngrowth model. Often, these methods will produce similar estimates of the cost of capital; seldom will the two\\nmethods provide the same value.\\nIn our example for Bluebonnet Industries, the CAPM estimated the cost of equity capital as 13.4%. The\\nconstant dividend growth model estimated the cost of capital as 14.24%. The exact value of the WACC\\ncalculation depends on which of these estimates is used. It is important to remember that the WACC is an\\nestimate that is based on a number of assumptions that financial managers made.\\nFor example, using the CAPM requires assumptions be made regarding the values of the risk-free interest rate,\\nthe market risk premium, and a firm’s beta. The risk-free interest rate is generally determined using US\\nTreasury security yields. In theory, the yield on US Treasury securities that have a maturity equivalent to the\\nlength of the company’s investors’ investment horizon should be used. It is common for financial analysts to\\nuse yields on long-term US Treasury bonds to determine the risk-free rate.\\nTo estimate the market risk premium, analysts turn to historical data. Because this historical data is used to\\nestimate the future market risk premium, the question arises of how many years of historical data should be\\nused. Using more years of historical data can lead to more accurate estimates of what the average past return\\nhas been, but very old data may have little relevance if today’s financial market environment is different from\\nwhat it was in the past. Old data may have little relevance for investors’ expectations today. Typical market risk\\npremiums used by financial managers range from 5% to 8%.\\n17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital 513', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The first two estimates are based\\non the beta provided by MarketWatch for each of the companies. A risk-free rate of 3% is assumed. Market\\nrisk premiums of both 5% and of 8% are considered. A market risk premium of 5% would suggest that long-\\nrun investors who hold a well-diversified portfolio, such as one with all of the stocks in the S&P 500, will\\naverage a return 5 percentage points higher than the risk-free rate, or 8%.

The beta provided by Yahoo! Finance is much\\nhigher, at 2.26. Using this higher beta results in an estimated equity cost of capital for Goodyear Tire and\\nRubber between 14.30% and 21.08%. This leaves the financial managers of Goodyear Tire and Rubber with\\nan estimate of the equity cost of capital between 9.20% and 21.08%, using a range of reasonable\\nassumptions.\\nWhat is a financial manager to do when one estimate is more than twice as large as another estimate? A\\nfinancial manager who believes the equity cost of capital is close to 9% is likely to make very different\\nchoices from one who believes the cost is closer to 21%. This is why it is important for a financial manager\\nto have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know\\nthe historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to\\nknow that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are\\nso different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic\\nenvironment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going\\nforward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what\\nthe numbers will be going forward.\\nIt is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do\\nsee a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has\\na beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of\\nequity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta\\nless than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta\\ngreater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range.\\nRecall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of\\nfood products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but\\nduring expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus,\\ncompanies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost\\nof capital below 8% to 11%.\\nThe sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods,\\npeople fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back\\non these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have\\nhigher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost\\nof capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than\\nin lower-risk companies.\\nThe CAPM estimate depends on assumptions made, but issues also exist with the constant dividend growth\\nmodel. First, the constant dividend growth model can be used only for companies that pay dividends. Second,\\nthe model assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate in the future, an assumption that is not\\nalways reasonable. It also assumes that the financial manager accurately forecasts the growth rate of\\ndividends; any error in this forecast results in an error in estimating the cost of equity capital.\\nGiven the differences in assumptions made when using the constant dividend growth model and the CAPM to\\nestimate the equity cost of capital, it is not surprising that the numbers from the two models differ. When\\nestimating the cost of equity capital for a particular firm, financial managers must examine the assumptions\\nmade for both approaches and decide which set of assumptions is more realistic for that particular company.\\n17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital 515', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Recall that the expected return to shareholders equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The\\nrisk-free rate has remained 4%. With leverage, the risk premium rises from 10% to 15.94%.\\nWhy does this risk premium increase? Recall that debt holders are paid before equity holders. Equity holders\\nare residual claimants; they will only receive payment if there is money left over after the debt holders are fully\\npaid. The business is risky. You are certain that the company will have cash flow of at least $18,000 at the end\\nof the year and that $17,680 will be paid to the debt holders. Therefore, if the company performs poorly\\n(perhaps bad weather results in the cancellation of much of the cycling competition) and the cash flows fall\\nway below what you are expecting, there may be only several hundred dollars left for the shareholders.\\nWhen the firm was unlevered, if the cash flow at the end of the year was only $18,000, the shareholders would\\nreceive $18,000. When leverage is used, the same cash flow would result in shareholders receiving only $320.\\nThe risk to the shareholders increases as leverage is used; thus, the risk premium that shareholders require\\nalso increases as leverage is used.\\nLeverage and the WACC\\nWhat happens to the WACC as leverage is used? To figure this out, we must calculate the weights of debt and\\nequity in the capital structure:\\nIn perfect capital markets, an assumption we are making for now, there are no taxes. Because we are using\\nonly debt and common stock, the weight of preferred stock is zero, and our WACC can be calculated as\\nNotice that the use of leverage does not change the WACC. When only equity was used to finance the\\nbusiness, stockholders required a 14% expected return to encourage them to let the firm use their capital.\\nWhen leverage was used, the debt holders only required a 4% return. However, the existence of debt holders,\\nwho stand in front of shareholders in the order of claimants, puts shareholders in a riskier position. There is a\\ngreater chance that the shareholders will not receive payment from this uncertain business. Thus, the\\nshareholders require a higher rate of return to let the leveraged firm use their capital.\\nThe cost-savings benefits of using lower-cost debt in your company’s capital structure are exactly offset by the\\nhigher return that shareholders require when leverage is used. Mathematically, the increase in the cost of\\nequity when leverage is used will be proportional to the debt–equity ratio. Financial managers refer to this\\noutcome as MM Proposition II. The relationship is expressed by the formula\\nwhere ru is the required return to equity holders of the unlevered firm.\\nTable 17.4 shows how the cost of equity increases as the weight of debt in the capital structure increases. As\\nthe company uses more debt, the risk to equity holders increases. Because equity holders risk that there will\\nbe no residual money after bondholders are paid, the equity holders require a higher rate of return to invest in\\nthe company as its use of leverage increases. Although debt holders face less risk than equity holders, the risk\\nthat they face increases as the amount of debt the company takes on increases. Once the company’s debt\\nexceeds its guaranteed cash flow, which is $18,000 in our example, debt holders face some risk that the\\ncompany will not be able to pay them. At that point, the cost of debt rises above the risk-free rate.

The\\nadvantage of using debt is the interest tax shield. The disadvantage of using debt is that it increases the risk of\\nfinancial distress and the costs associated with financial distress.\\nA company has an incentive to increase leverage to exploit the interest tax shield. However, too much debt will\\nmake it more likely that the company will default and incur financial distress costs.

It is\\nexpensive for Netflix to fund the production of this content.

Vu is the\\nvalue of the unlevered firm, or the firm with no debt. As the firm begins to add debt to its capital structure, the\\nvalue of the firm increases due to the interest tax shield. The more debt the company takes on, the greater the\\ntax benefit it receives, up until the point at which the company’s interest expense exceeds its earnings before\\ninterest and taxes (EBIT).
